INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

A still shot on an OLD MAN's face. 70 - 90 years old. He is sleeping. We watch him breathe for a while.

A still shot on the heart rate machine. We watch as the waves beep across the screen. SUDDENLY, the line goes flat. We hear the classic "BEEEEEEE" sound of a heart machine.

INT. HOSPITAL HALL
A FEMALE DOCTOR RUNS through the halls as she tries to reach the room where the emergency is coming. She runs into the room.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
The female doctor enters the room in a RUSH. She stops, out of breath, to scan the room for the right bed with the emergency. She sees it is one of the beds closed behind the plastic curtains separating the "rooms". We see a red light flashing, lighting up the plastic room in a red glow, every second. She rushes to it, we follow her, she comes right to the "door" of the plastic flaps and throws it open.

Inside we see the old man we saw previously, now awake, sitting upright with a LITTLE GIRL (around 5 -7 years of age) sitting next to him on the bed. The beeping heart monitoring machine is deafening. The little girl's one hand is blocking her ear, the other is holding a teddy bear, so she uses her shoulder to block her open ear.

We cut back to the doctor's face, she is very confused but the situation is still urgent.

FEMALE DOCTOR
What is going on here?!

More a statement than a question, she doesn't pause for an answer. She HITS A SWITCH on the heart monitoring machine that mutes the deafening beep, but the red light keeps flashing. With the other hand she readies her stethoscope. She slips it under the old man's shirt and listens closely to his heart rate.

OLD MAN
Well...I don't think I'm gone just yet.

The doctor is done listening. She calms down knowing the old man is alright.

FEMALE DOCTOR
Well, you don't sound gone either.

The doctor doesn't yet pay attention to the conversation just yet as she still has some urgency to figure out what is going on. She turns to the heart monitoring machine and starts following a main electric line coming out at the bottom of it. Her hand slides across it to make sure it is fine. She stops at the point where it gets lost under the bed. She turns and walks around the front of the bed.

FEMALE DOCTOR
(pointing at the old man and the little girl)
You two having a tea party at 2am? Should I bring you some biscuits?

OLD MAN
I woke up with it staring me dead in the eyes. I have no idea where it came from.

The doctor finds the wire disconnected on the floor. She picks it up. Now she needs to find the other missing connection. She restarts the search by starting at the wire coming from the old man's finger. She follows it. It gets lost under the little girl sitting on the bed.

FEMALE DOCTOR
(says in a bad, high english accent)
Excuse me MADAM, would you mind lifting your BOTTOM for me.

The little girl laughs a little at the english accent, but then lifts herself so the wire could be pulled out. The doctor has found the other connection. She connects the wire, the red flashing light stops.

OLD MAN
Confirmed. I am alive.

The doctor smiles and shakes her head. She walks to the heart monitoring machine to turn the mute button off.

OLD MAN
(copies the english tone of the doctor, but only for the bold word)
And what is your name little MADAM?

No response from the little girl.

FEMALE DOCTOR
LITTLE MADAM over here is from B2. I've been playing Tom and Jerry with her the whole night. She's driving us crazy. Her mother just went through a (serious surgery name) so she has been out of action for the entire night. No other family around to keep her at bay (puts her hand on the little girl's head).

The doctor smiles at the little girl. The typical "you cute naughty thing" type of smile.

FEMALE DOCTOR
Come on madam, let's go back to the castle.

The doctor starts picking up the little girl to lift her off the bed.

OLD MAN
(lightly grabs the little girl's leg)
Hold on. Let her stay. I've been rolling around the entire night myself. Some company would be good, haven't had a good chat for a long time.

FEMALE DOCTOR
What!? It's 2am, not tea time.

OLD MAN
Come oooon. You know I haven't had anyone visit for weeks.

The doctor thinks about it. Looks at the little girl. She is a bit confused but doesn't seem too bothered either.

FEMALE DOCTOR
Fine. When you're done with your tea time, give me a buzz and I'll bring the net.

The doctor tidies the bed a bit, then walks to the curtain door and turns around (ready to close it).

FEMALE DOCTOR
Keep it down spice girls. There are other patients around here that aren't too fond of 2am tea times...and I'm not bringing you guys any biscuits.

The doctor closes the curtains. The old man turns to the little girl. They stare at each other for a while.

(From here on out, the old man whispers his dialog to not make a noise)

OLD MAN
So, Madam, should we try this again? What's your name?

No response, just staring.

OLD MAN
Okay, so you're the shy type. No problem (he points at the tedding in her hands). What is his name?

The little girl looks down at the finger pointing to the teddy. She then looks up at the old man.
LITTLE GIRL
Where's your mamma?

OLD MAN
(surprised by the odd question)
Oh, you DO talk...well...see, I lost my family a very, very long time ago.

LITTLE GIRL
Lost? What do you mean lost?

OLD MAN
Like...they're not with me anymore.

LITTLE GIRL
Like...gone?

OLD MAN
Yeah, like gone.

LITTLE GIRL
Why don't you go outside and find them?

OLD MAN
(a small laugh, knowing the little girl doesn't get it)
Uhm, no...not gone like lost your teddy. More gone like...

He can't think of a good example. They pause for a bit.

OLD MAN
Well, I guess we don't have anything better to do, do we? You up for some story time?

The little girl's eyes grow, she knows this line! The old man readies the girl for a story. He puts a big pillow behind her. He throws a bit of the blanket over her lap.

OLD MAN
You comfy?

The girl just stares in excitement, doesn't reply to the question.

OLD MAN
(laughs)
I'll take that face as a yes...Okay. How does it work again?....Oh right! Okay...A long, long time ago, on an ocean, far, far away...my dad bought a sailboat. We went out on our first sail as a family, ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SEA!

The scene fades out with a CLOSE UP on the old man's face.

EXT. SAILBOAT - DAY

We fade the shot in on the two boy's faces. There needs to be a clear comparison with the old man and the two boys. The old man is CLEARLY one of the two boys.

We cut to a wide top-down shot showing a sailboat on the ocean.

An OLDER BROTHER (+-15 years old), a YOUNGER BROTHER (+-10 years old) and their MOTHER are sitting on a couch in front of a table. DAD is standing on the other side of the table (dressed with a Hawaiian button shirt, a red cape and a magicians hat on his head), clearly busy showing the 3 of them something.

(For the entire scene everything and everyone needs to gently rock back and forth on the sailboat)

DAD
Now, ladieeees and gentlemaaaan, for my final act.

Dad picks up a big red silk cloth and then searches around for something else. We see the remains of a few other tricks he has just done. The classic white rope, a jumbled bunch of cards etc.

DAD
(looking for the item)
Where did I put that...(reaches in his shirt pocket)...Ah! For my final act! I'll take this every day model of a cruise ship.

Dad puts down a model of a cruise ship on the table in front of them. Then he lifts the red silk cloth up, blocking the family's view of the cruise ship model. The family only sees a big red cloth in their view. Dad shakes it as if it is building up magic.

Sound Design: We hear a type of drum roll composition.

DAD
And I'll turn it into...into...intooooo

We as the audience now see the view from behind Dad. We see the table with the cruise ship model on it and dad shaking the cloth in front of the family. He is almost sticking it in their faces to make sure they don't see past it. Dad is completely focused on something behind him though, in the water, anxiously waiting for something to "line up". The cloth shaking is becoming awkwardly long now.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Daaaaaaad...Come ooonn..

Younger brother gets interrupted by Dad!

DAD
TADAAAAAA!!!

Sound Design: The drum roll suddenly quiets down but is still going.

Dad pulls away the red cloth. We see a point of view shot of the family. The visual focus shifts from the cloth, to dad, then to the view behind dad. The view is completely covered by a MASSIVE black metal.

Both of the brothers dash and climb over the table to get to the other side. They look up.

We see a breathtaking shot of a MASSIVE cruise ship passing their sailboat.

Sound Design: The drumroll reaches its climax. It is loud, inspiring and amazing.

FADE OUT:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

OLD MAN
It was the BIGGEST, most amazing ship I have EVER seen.

LITTLE GIRL
(amazed)
Like an elephant?!

OLD MAN
LIKE A MILLION ELEPHANTS!

The girl doesn't say anything but we see her face as her eyes grow in amazement, that "wooooow" look.

OLD MAN
We were sailing right in the lane of all the great cruise ships (waves his hand in the air to show how great it was)...But then...a few days later. A storm came up out of nowhere.

FADE OUT:

Black screen.

Sound Design: We start hearing loud wind, rain, lightning and waves.

INT. SAILBOAT - NIGHT
We are inside the sailboat, a cramped space. The sailboat is just over an ankle height full of water. Mom flips couch pillows over to open the bottom containers. She is desperately looking for something.

MOM
WHERE IS IT!?

DAD
(shouting from deck above)
BEHIND THE BATHROOM DOOR, IN THE CUPBOARD.

SHE FINDS IT. A big yellow plastic bag. It isn't heavy but it is bulky. She hands it to the older brother (more like slams it into his chest, not giving him the option to decline taking it). She picks up the younger brother.

MOM
OUTSIDE! NOW!!!

Mom leads the way up the stairs to the deck (just a few meters). Dad is standing at the entrance, holding open the small hatch/door to exit onto the deck. The water is rushing down the stairs into the interior. Right as mom steps out, a big wave hits the sailboat. Everyone falls to one side. The older brother is in the cramped stairway so the walls give him good support to stay upright. Mom is pushed over with the younger brother but Dad manages to keep them up while balancing himself against the side of the hatch. The older brother reaches the top as well.

We as viewers finally see the outside of the deck. It is storming, dark, windy and the waves are like walls on all the sides of the sailboat. Dad grabs the yellow package out of the older brother's hands and pulls a red tag on it. A big yellow life raft pops open. It is made of two yellow rings (like a swimming pool) and a plastic roof covering the inside. The roof isn't upright though, so it is just lying in the space that one would get into. The plastic roof has a slit on the one side, the door flaps.

Dad turns the life raft  around to get to the door flaps while he battles to lower it in the strong wind. He finally sets it on the water next to the sailboat.

DAD
(looks at the older brother)
COME ON!!!

The older brother runs forward while trying to keep his balance. Mom, holding the younger brother, follows him. The older brother reaches the life raft  and starts climbing in. Dad pushes him inside, so he practically falls into the raft, rolling to the back. Our viewpoint follows the older brother rolling underneath the floppy plastic roof.

(OUR VIEWPOINT STAYS INSIDE THE LIFE RAFT, LOOKING OUTWARDS, FOR THE REST OF THE SCENE)

The door flaps are flapping open and closed. Through it we see Dad holding onto the side of the life raft . Dad looks back at mom holding the younger brother. SUDDENLY, a massive wave starts DROPPING the surface of the life raft downwards. Dad, leaning over the railing of the sailboat, can't hold on anymore as the life raft slips away. He keeps reaching further and further down over the railing to try and grab the life raft, but he doesn't get it

MOM
No, no, NOOOO!!!

The older brother's view starts getting covered with the view of the side of the sailboat. The sailboat is moving upwards, he is moving downwards. The older brother's view moves from Dad, to the railing, to some buoys hanging next to the sailboat, to the bottom of the sailboat. The movement pauses for a second. Then the view starts moving back up. The older brother REALISES THIS. He rushes to the door flaps and grabs a hold of one of the buoys hanging next to the sailboat as they pass him. It is hanging on a rope, so he grips it and pulls it against his chest. The view returns to the railing, and then to Dad. Dad is hanging far over the railing, waiting for the life raft to reach his hand again. When he grabs it, he grabs it with both hands this time and pulls it towards him to keep it secure.

DAD
(looks over his shoulder at Mom and the younger brother)
QUICKLY!

Mom moves closer and throws the younger brother inside. He rolls past the older brother, who is still holding the buoy on the rope. There is total chaos now in terms of our view. Mom starts getting in. Just as her one foot goes up to get inside the same thing happens again. The life raft's surface starts getting pulled down. Mom FALLS OVER the side of the railing, deciding she'd rather wash away with the life raft than stay on the sailboat. She is now holding onto the raft for dear life. Her body is in the water. Dad's hands are not on the side of the raft anymore. Mom slips as the plastic sides are completely covered in water. The older brother throws the buoy to the side and grabs one of Mom's hands and starts pulling. It is like holding on to a bar of soap. Mom's hand immediately slips out the older brother's hand.

OLDER BROTHER
MOM!!!

As he wants to look outside to save mom the buoy slides past him going outwards. He GRABS it. Holding onto the buoy will keep them connected to the sailboat. The door flaps have blown closed. All we can see is the inside of the life raft. The rope attached to the buoy leads out the door. The older brother pulls on the buoy as it slides in his hands. He finally pulls it closer to where he starts gripping the rope. The buoy is now behind him.

OLDER BROTHER
(looks over his shoulder at his younger brother behind him
HELP ME!

The younger brother snaps out of it, tears are flowing down his face as he grabs the buoy in his arms. The buoy is just about as big as him. They both pull with all their strength. There is a good amount of water sloshing around inside with them. The wind is blowing the floppy roof in all directions. The older brother braces his feet against the door's tube side. They both pull with all their strength. We hear as Mom and Dad scream stuff from the outside, but we can't make out what it is through the storm.

SUDDENLY, the brothers shoot to the back of the life raft with the buoy and rope still in their hands. They look at each other in surprise to figure out what just happened. The older brother looks down at the rope in his hand, his face realises something.

OLDER BROTHER
(while frantically reeling in the rope from outside)
No. No. NO. NO. NOO!!!

The rope is completely limp as the older brother is pulling it. He pulls and pulls. Finally, he reaches it. THE END OF THE ROPE IS IN HIS HANDS.

OLDER BROTHER
(while stumbling towards the door flaps in the wet and unstable life raft)
MOM!!! DAD!!! MOM!!! DAD!!!

He pushes the door flaps open with his one hand. A point of view shot from the older brother shows a wall of water building in front of the life raft, we look upwards and the peak of a wave is going to crash right now. He quickly closes the door flaps with both hands and holds it as if it is going to protect them from the wave. THE WAVE HITS THEM and he is slushed towards his brother at the back of the life raft. The scene cuts in the chaos of the wave hitting them.

We see a black screen.

Sound Design: The volume of the storm is lowered more and more until it goes away completely.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE NIGHT
We see the little girl's face. Her eyes are big.

LITTLE GIRL
Were you dead???!

The old man chuckles at the girl's question as he puts his hand on her head and ruffles her hair.

OLD MAN
Of course not, Madam. My brother and I...were fine...So...the next morning...

FADE OUT:

Sound Design: We start hearing small waves softly hit the beach.

EXT. BEACH - NOON
Our view is inside the life raft. The yellow plastic roof is still hanging loosely, not exactly a great roof. More like a blanket. We see the bright sunlight glow through the roof. The brothers are sleeping at the back of the raft (opposite side of the door flaps). The older one is holding the younger one. We see a shallow amount of water slowly sloshing back and forth in the raft. The scene is calm.

A wide shot reveals that they are being pulled towards a beach, just starting to enter the WAVE ZONE. There are a few SHARP ROCKS sticking out the water.

Sound Design: An ominous rumble starts as we see the sharp rocks.

Back in the life raft we see the water lift the raft a bit...and then drop it. The younger brother barely wakes up to this, enough to wipe a tickle off his nose, then back to sleep. Again a second wave lifts the raft, this time even higher...and drops it. The younger brother slips out of the older brother's arms as the water angle's the raft and slides them both towards the entrance. The smaller brother almost falls out but then rolls back in. They both slowly wake up from this.

A wide shot reveals they are in the wave zone where the waves are at their biggest and they are surrounded by sharp rocks sticking out the water.

Back in the life raft, a big wave starts tilting the raft to one side. They roll together and grab each other as they get frightened of the fact that something is wrong. Then the raft tilts almost 90 degrees the other way. They both shoot to the other side. They hit the door side of the raft and the younger brother is catapulted out of the raft into the ocean. At the same time the raft hits a sharp rock that tears the raft's air ring. We see a close up of the raft's hole underwater, blowing out air like a popped balloon.

The scene is complete chaos in the foamy water. We see shots of the younger brother's body getting tumbled underwater as he gets smashed against a sharp rock that RIPS OPEN A BIT OF HIS LEG. The older brother, still in the raft, QUICKLY jumps up on his knees and opens the door flaps to search for his brother. He is trying to stabilise himself in the life raft that is blowing down. He looks like a person stuck in a jumping castle that is being turned off. He frantically searches the foamy water until he sees a hand popping out indicating "Here I am!". The older brother dives in that direction underwater, not seeing much, until he swims right into his brother. He grabs him tightly by the waist. They both pop up from the foamy water. The older brother is trying to keep the younger brother above the surface more than he is caring about himself. The younger brother is choking on water trying to catch his breath, not even aware of the big slash in his leg.

They are not far from the shore so they swim there instead of going back to the life raft. A few swells pick them up and down as they reach an area where the older brother can stand. As soon as this happens you can see he stops swimming with his arm and starts carrying the younger brother out, while slowly walking. When the water reaches waist height the older brother repositions the younger brother. Putting him in his arms like a person sitting in a chair. Knees bent on one arm while the other arm holds the younger brother under the armpits. He carries his younger brother out, not an easy task with all the water in their clothes.

As soon as it is a safe enough depth, the older brother drops the younger brother like a big bag of potatoes that you have been carrying for 4 hours straight. The beach area they are in is covered in dead seaweed strands, sloshing back and forth in the water. The older brother falls onto the sad with his hands and knees. A close up shows his one arm (the one that was carrying the younger brother's legs) is covered in blood. He doesn't notice this as they are both COMPLETELY out of breath, hearts racing, still trying to wake up and choking on all the sea water they inhaled. A wide shot reveals the BLOOD TRACK BEHIND THEM and also that the LIFE RAFT HAS WASHED UP ON THE BEACH AS WELL.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Help. Help! HELP!!

We look back at the younger brother, sitting, as he holds his leg to stop it from bleeding. The older brother quickly drags forward in the sand to inspect the leg. The blood is pulsing out of his leg. The older brother searches around as if anything around him is going to help. He can't find anything useful. He NOTICES a long piece of seaweed hanging from his arm. He grabs it, looks at it, and quickly wraps it around his brother's leg, above the wound. As he tightens it, it SNAPS. He quickly grabs another, thicker strand lying next to them and tries it as well. But again, it snaps. He looks around again while helping his younger brother put pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding. He looks down and realises his jacket.

OLDER BROTHER
Wait!

He quickly takes off his jacket and wraps it around his brother's legs. Tightly pulling the material to lessen the bleeding.

The older brother stands up and drags the younger brother from behind to a more safe spot on the beach under a palm tree. He lays him against the palm tree. The younger brother is crying from the pain.

OLDER BROTHER
Calm down, calm down...It's okay. We are fine...We are fine.

He gives his younger brother a big comforting hug and holds him a while till the crying slows down.

OLDER BROTHER
Listen, there are medical supplies on the life raft. I'm just going to fetch them right there (points backwards to the life raft that has washed up on the beach, not far from them). I'll be right back. I promise. Okay?

The younger brother is still sipping on his tears but understands well enough to nod "Yes". A wide shot shows the older brother running towards the life raft.

FADE OUT:

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
OLDER BROTHER
And there...we...GO.

The older brother finishes tying the bandage on the younger brother's leg. In front of them is a small medical bag, a glass bottle of liquid (it reads "Antibiotics") and some other medical equipment that has been used to tend to the wound. The younger brother has stopped crying but his face is still full of snot and tears. The younger brother wipes his face clean as much as he can.

OLDER BROTHER
Is it too tight?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No...I don't think so? (looks up at his brother as if his brother would know the answer)

OLDER BROTHER
Well...when you bring your first girlfriend back to home. I'll tell her it was a SHARK bite! (he tickles his younger brother's ribcage as he says this)

They laugh it off and sit back against the palm tree. The scene is calm as they look to the ocean distance, the sun is starting to set. We just watch them for a bit. The younger brother is still slowly swallowing his tears. The older brother holds the younger brother over the shoulders.

OLDER BROTHER
I spy with my little eye...somethingggg...blue.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(he suddenly sits upright in search, EXCITED about the game but still sipping away the tears)
The ocean!

OLDER BROTHER
Come on, that easy? No way maaaan.

YOUNGER BROTHER
The sky!

Older brother just looks at his younger brother with a "really" facial expression.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Umhhh...(he really searches this time). This!

He picks up the scissors from the medical bag that was lying between the medical supplies.

OLDER BROTHER
Ding! Ding! Ding! Correcto!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Okay! Okay!...I spy with my little eye...somethingggg...brown.

OLDER BROTHER
What? Like sand brown or like dirt brown?

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm not saying!

OLDER BROTHER
Ok, sand then?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Nooope.

The older brother scans the environment.

OLDER BROTHER
Those rocks that ate your leg.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(laughs a bit)
Nope.

OLDER BROTHER
Uhhmmm...(looks around and puts his hand on the palm tree's trunk) This!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Nope!

OLDER BROTHER
Damn...(looks around, sees a coconut half buried in the sand) That coconut in the sand there (points to it).

YOUNGER BROTHER
Haha yeah you got me!

OLDER BROTHER
That was a good one! Okay, me again. I spy with my little eye...somethingggg...red.

Silence. Even more silence.

OLDER BROTHER
Hey come on, find something red!

More silence.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Where's Mom and Dad?

The younger brother is looking out to the ocean. The older brother looks down at his younger brother as the question lands.

OLDER BROTHER
Uhmmm...

The older brother looks out to the ocean as well.

OLDER BROTHER
They're out there.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Out where?

OLDER BROTHER
Out there. On the ocean.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are they dead?

OLDER BROTHER
No (his voice sounded screechy, he quickly clears his throat). No. They're looking for us. They'll come and get us soon. We just have to wait here.

YOUNGER BROTHER
How long are they gonna take?

OLDER BROTHER
A while...

YOUNGER BROTHER
But...how do you know they aren't dead?

OLDER BROTHER
Hey! You're cheating! You still need to find something red you know! (tickles his younger brother on the ribs)

We watch them sit under the palm tree from a wide shot, the sun is starting to set (around 4-5pm). They continue their game while the scene fades away.

The camera turns to the ocean. We clearly see the RAFT, WASHED UP ON THE BEACH. The time speeds up, the sun sets completely, the moon comes up, and then the sun starts coming back up again. The camera turns back towards the beach.

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
As the camera turns back to the beach, we see the raft is no longer where it was. We see the raft has been dragged from where it was all the way to a CAVE where the raft is sitting now. IT IS NOT A CAVE AS IN A ROOM INSIDE A MOUNTAIN, IT IS MORE LIKE A LARGE OVERHANG OF ROCKS. The life raft's yellow plastic has been lifted up using branches, like a tent.

The camera moves along the path that the life raft has dragged in the sand. The camera transitions to a point of view shot as it follows the trail (we know this because the smooth camera movements turn into a walking movement and the lens changes closer to something of the human eye). The camera's point of view is now something that is approaching the raft tent. Slowly, it CREEPS forward towards the tent. It pauses in front of the tent. It FLIPS OPEN the raft flaps and we see the younger brother lying inside of the raft. It makes a loud noise! The younger brother JUMPS up in a massive fright! The younger brother is frozen, staring out the tent.

OLDER BROTHER
Surprise!!!

A shot from the younger brother's point of view shows the older brother smiling at the door with a stack of bananas in the one hand and coconuts in the other hand.

INT. CAVE - LATER
They are both sitting and in front of them we see scraps of the bananas and coconuts. The younger brother is still picking away at some scraps. The older brother is busy weaving something round, like a wheel.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Won't it rip, when you pull me?

They both look at the yellow plastic raft. They have taken it off of the "tent" setup. It is now lying in front of them, pulled to one point. It has the shape of a sled. As if someone is going to drag someone else in it.

OLDER BROTHER
Well, I hope not, cause I don't see how you're going to walk around this island on that leg. And there is no way I'm carrying you all the way.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Why not? I can sit on your shoulders, like Dad.

OLD MAN
I'm not Dad, and you're not a feather...

YOUNGER BROTHER
(laughs)
...I can always hop on one leg, like a BUNNY RABBIT.

The younger brother gets up and gives us a demo of his hopping skills.

OLDER BROTHER
So you're going to do that...around the whole island?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah!

The older brother looks at the younger brother. A LOOK OF FEAR GROWS ON THE OLDER BROTHER'S FACE. The younger brother notices it.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What?!

OLDER BROTHER
Your...your ears!

The older brother touches his own ears to indicate what he means. The younger brother touches his ears as well, wondering if there is a spider on them or something.

YOUNGER BROTHER
WHAT!?

OLDER BROTHER
They're, GROWING!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Growing!? What do you mean?

OLDER BROTHER
They are getting longer by the second!

The younger brother touches his ears in fear, trying to figure out what is going wrong.

OLDER BROTHER
I think...

The younger brother pauses, they're looking each other dead in the eyes.

OLDER BROTHER
I THINK YOU'RE TURNING INTO A BUNNY RABBIT!

They stare at each other with no response. Finally the younger brother catches the joke.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Ha-ha-ha (sarcastic). YOU'RE turning into a bunny rabbit!

OLDER BROTHER
laughs I'm not the one hopping around am I?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Whatever! I'm not a bunny rabbit!

The older brother laughs it off.

OLDER BROTHER
Besides, there is no way you're hopping around an island on one leg. Using both your legs is hard enough.

The younger brother sits down.

YOUNGER BROTHER
How many people are on the island?

OLDER BROTHER
At the moment...two.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Will we find more people?

The older brother doesn't reply, but just shrugs his shoulders while still crafting at the wheel shaped item.

EXT. BEACH - MORNING

OLDER BROTHER
You ready captain?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yup!

They are on the beach. The younger brother is sitting inside the blown-down plastic raft. There are some bananas with him as well as the medical kit. The younger brother grabs a hold of the front of the plastic, as if he is going to ride the raft like a slay in the snow. Both the brothers have pirate hats on, made from palm leaves.

OLDER BROTHER
You can't be the captain of a ship without a wheel you know.

The older brother picks up the item he was crafting earlier and gives it to his brother. It looks like the classic wheel used to steer a big pirate ship. The younger brother takes it and immediately acts like he is turning the boat already.

The older brother takes the front side of plastic and lifts it over his shoulders. They start walking. The older brother slowly drags his brother over the sand, not an easy task.

OLDER BROTHER
(doesn't sing it to the melody, just asks)
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(sings to the melody)
Sponge, bob. Square, pants!

OLDER BROTHER
(hums the melody but doesn't know the words)
nah, nah, nah...and porous is he!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sponge, bob. Square, pants!

We hear them softly continue...

The original Spongebob Squarepants song takes over...

EXT. COMPILATION SHOTS
They battle their way around the beach.

They sleep over at multiple points (a few days pass).

They find plastic water bottles.

They find fresh water for the water bottles (water running down the cliff faces).

The younger brother starts walking here and there with a walking stick (but his leg doesn't heal completely yet).

The scenes end with the song: ...spongy booooooob, Square paaaaaants. Ha - hahaha (flute)

FADE OUT:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

OLDER BROTHER
Don't you think it is time to start walking a bit again. You were jumping around just fine earlier.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(acting dramatic)
Yeah but my leg is soooooo sore today! So sore....

The older brother is pulling the younger brother on the plastic. It is a slow and tiring job. The younger brother is just riding along, picking up shells as they go. The plastic also has some bottles of water and other scraps in it by now.

YOUNGER BROTHER
You know what I think?

At the same time, the older brother looks up in front of him. Something catches his eye. He stops pulling the plastic.

OLDER BROTHER
(replies without much attention)
What?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(the older brother isn't listening)
Riding this thing isn't so fun. You don't want to do it, trust me. The sand keeps getting in your underpants. I think pulling is much more fu...

The older brother drops the plastic and dashes off to a top of a hill to get a better view.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Hey!?

The older brother reaches a better viewpoint, The younger brother is quickly trying to catch up with his walking stick, The older brother falls to his knees like someone who just completed a marathon. Head in his hands. The younger brother finally arrives.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What is going on?

The older brother doesn't answer. The younger brother looks to where his brother was looking. We see the beach they started at. We see the drag-line of the plastic on the sand heading the other way.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Wooooow (impressed). Did we go right around?

No response from the older brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
That is soooooo awesooooome!!!

OLDER BROTHER
(looks up at his brother, confused)
What? How is that awesome?

YOUNGER BROTHER
It is only you and me now, like when you take me camping at the lake!

A pause.

OLDER BROTHER
Yeah.

INT. CAVE - LATER
They drag the plastic back to the original cave. They both settle down, tired of the big adventure.

OLDER BROTHER
Damn, I'd love to have Mom cook us up a meal right now you know.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Where are they, why haven't they come yet.

OLDER BROTHER
...you remember when you lost your green dinosaur?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah?

OLDER BROTHER
And it took us like days to find it?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah?

OLDER BROTHER
But then all the time it was right in your room. Behind your bedside table.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, cause it fell down the back.

OLDER BROTHER
Exactly. This is just like that. They know we are somewhere, they just don't know where. So it will take a while to find us.

No response. They just sit for a while, catching their breath. Making themselves comfortable.

OLDER BROTHER
Oh, we should probably have a look at that shark bite of yours.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah but it is fine (he lifts his leg in the air). See, it works.

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
Yeah I don't mean if it works or not. We need to clean the wound. Otherwise UGLY BUGS WILL START GROWING IN YOUR LEG.

The younger brother stares at his older brother, face FULL OF FEAR. Frozen, holding his leg in the air.

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
I'm joking! Just come here man. We really need to check it out.

The younger brother moves closer. The older brother fetches the medical kit. WE SEE THE GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS AGAIN. The younger brother sits down and "offers" his leg to his older brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Is it going to hurt?

OLDER BROTHER
Sure.

The younger brother stares at his older brother with a face full of fear.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Really?

OLDER BROTHER
Only if you're a baby...

The younger brother looks at his leg and focuses (he's not a baby!). The older brother starts unwrapping the bandage. As it gets closer to the wound, it starts sticking because of all the blood. Pulling the bandage apart is becoming more and more painful to the younger brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No, no, wait!
The older brother pauses the unwrapping.

OLDER BROTHER
What, are you a baby?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No, I'm not a baby! It just hurts okay!

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
I'm sorry...but we really need to do this. I'll be careful. Okay?

The younger brother just nods (he is pretty tense). The older brother slowly and carefully unwraps the last bit of the bandage. The older brother lifts the last bit of bandage, he can see the wound, but the younger brother can't see it from his point of view.

OLDER BROTHER
(FACE FULL OF FEAR AS HE STARES AT THE WOUND)
Oh my word...

The younger brother stares at his older brother. The younger brother starts freaking out as well.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What?!

OLDER BROTHER
It's....it's....

The younger brother can't take the tension anymore.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(almost starts crying)
WHAT!?

The younger brother takes the situation into his own hands and rips the last bit of bandage away to reveal the wound. IT LOOKS GOOD.

OLDER BROTHER
IT'S PERFECT!!!

The younger brother just stares for a bit, taking in the situation...

YOUNGER BROTHER
That was NOT funny!!!

The younger brother bumps his older brother away. The older brother laughs as the bump throws him onto his side.

OLDER BROTHER
Woooooah! (gets himself back up)...no but really. It looks good.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Really? And don't make a joke again!

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
No, really. We still need to keep it clean, but it looks really good. It should heal nicely.

The older brother picks up the GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS.

OLDER BROTHER
This is going to burn a little bit, okay?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(pulls his leg away)
No, no, no I don't need it. It isn't sore. You just said it looks good.

OLDER BROTHER
Yeah I know, but this is the stuff that keeps the bugs out. That is why it burns a little bit. It burns all the bugs away.

YOUNGER BROTHER
But there aren't any bugs on it, look! (points at his wound)

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
Yeah but you can't see them. They are very, very, very small. Like invisible small.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No, but I don't want it!

OLDER BROTHER
(strict)
Hey! Come on. Give me your leg. It will be quick.

The younger brother eventually gives the older brother his leg. As he "hands over" his leg, the older brother QUICKLY splashes the liquid all over the wound.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(immediately pulls back his leg)
Ahhhhh!!! No, no, no! IT BUNS. Take it off please!!

OLDER BROTHER
It's over mannnnn. We're done. The bugs are no more!

The burn eventually stops after a while. The older brother puts down the GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS. We see there is much less liquid in the bottle now because of the splash.

OLDER BROTHER
I'm going to wash this off in the salt water (picks up and shows the bloody bandage). DON'T let it get dirty, okay! (points to his brother's wound) Otherwise you're grounded for a week.

The younger brother takes a hold of his leg to protect it from the elements.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Okay, okay, okay! I won't!

The older brother gets up and walks to the opening of the cave.

OLDER BROTHER
Christmas father is watching you! Keep it out of the sand.

The younger brother nods quickly, multiple times. The older brother runs off to the ocean with the bloody bandage.

EXT. BEACH
The older brother is up in a palm tree. Trying to whack off some coconuts. The younger brother is down on the sand, playing with shells like toy cars.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I think Mom and Dad are here?

OLDER BROTHER
You what? (as if he heard wrong)

YOUNGER BROTHER
Look (points with his hand to the ocean) Mom and Dad are here.

The older brother stops what he is busy with, looks at his brother first, and then to where he is pointing (to the ocean). He battles to see what his brother is talking about through the palm leaves. The younger brother stands up with his walking stick.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Wooooow, it is one of the big ones!

The older brother is still up in the palm tree. He is battling to search the ocean through the palm leaves...HE SEES IT.

A SHIP ON THE HORIZON. The older brother wipes the sweat off of his face with his sleeve to make sure he is not seeing something by mistake. The older brother's face freezes in surprise.

(THE MOOD OF THE SCENE CHANGES COMPLETELY FROM HERE ON OUT, A LOT MORE DARK AND SCARY)

Sound Design: A drowning sound, like a low rumble of fear.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Mammaaaaa!!! Dadddaaaaa!!! WHERE HERE!!! (while waving his walking stick in the air)

The older brother looks at his younger brother. Then to the ship in the distance. The older brother quickly slides down the palm tree, hurting himself a little on the way down.

OLDER BROTHER
It won't work, we're too far. Come! (grabs his brother by the arm and starts running)

The older brother doesn't even give the younger brother time to object to the situation. They both start running, slipping and tripping their way back to the cave. The older brother quickly grabs the life raft plastic and runs back out to the beach. He tries to use the raft as a flag. Waving it vigorously so that the ship might see the yellow plastic.

The younger brother is trying his best to help by screaming to his parents on the ship. The older brother tries waving the plastic for a while but then looks closely at the ship. It is really far away. The chance of them seeing the raft is really small. He drops the plastic down, it is still hanging in his hand. He thinks and looks around to try and find a solution...he looks at his brother screaming. He has a logo of The Human Torch on his t-shirt (superhero with fire powers).

OLDER BROTHER
Quickly! Go and fetch me as many pieces of wood as you can. We need to make the biggest fire in the world!

YOUNGER BROTHER
What? Why? It is day. We don't need light.

OLDER BROTHER
Just do it! PLEASE.

The split up. The younger brother runs to fetch wood, as fast as a cripple person with a walking stick can. The older brother runs into the bushy areas to find a few pieces of straight wood. He looks around, picks some up, checks them, and throws them down again. He is looking for some very specific pieces of wood. He gets a few of the sticks he needs, then he runs to where they have eaten coconuts in the cave. He grabs a few of the open, empty coconut shells. He runs to an open area at the beach. Next to the raft plastic where they were previously. He sits down on his knees and places the coconut shell in front of him like a bowl. He ruffles up the extra coconut shell hairs. He spits in his hands. He readies a spindle stick, placing it right on top of the coconut hairs.

OLDER BROTHER
(takes a deep breath first)
Come on, boy scout. You've got this.

He starts slowly spinning the spindle in his hands. He has clearly done this before. He is not rushing it at all. A very calm but steady spin.

We cut to the younger brother. He is somewhere in the bushes, picking up as many big sticks of wood that he can find. We watch him walk back to his older brother, battling with his leg and the walking stick.

The older brother is now spinning a little bit faster than he was previously. But still not at his fastest. The younger brother drops his very small pile of wood near the older brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Do I need to get more?

OLDER BROTHER
(doesn't look away from the coconut hairs at all) Yes. A LOT MORE! Every single piece of wood you can find.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Ok!

The younger brother runs back to get more wood. The older brother is focusing immensely on the task. He sees the slightest hint of smoke. He starts spinning faster and faster and faster. He has reached a point of speed where he is giving all he has. The smoke is becoming thicker and thicker as he does this. Finally he can't keep going, he is out of energy, but the coconut is smoking nicely. He picks it up and lightly blows on it. But as soon as he stopped spinning the smoke started getting thinner and thinner. At first blowing seemed to help, but the longer we watch the more it dies out again.

OLDER BROTHER
Dammit! Come on!

He takes a deep breath. He doesn't really have the energy to do another take but it is not like he is going to stop trying. He keeps going.

The younger brother comes back with another batch of wood.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Why are we making a fire?

No response from the concentrating older brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Hey! Why are we making a fire!?

The older brother suddenly stops, he needs a break anyways. But he is getting very pissed off. He doesn't have the patience for stupid questions now.

OLDER BROTHER
We need to make smoke okay! The only way they (points at the ship with his spindle) are going to see us, is if we make smoke. A lot of it!

The older brother starts spinning again.

OLDER BROTHER
(while spinning)
Stop asking stupid questions and just bring me more wood!

YOUNGER BROTHER
But...why don't we just swim to them?

OLDER BROTHER
(stops and looks his brother dead in the eyes with a very angry face)
NO! WE CAN'T. WOOD. NOW! (points in the general direction of more wood)

YOUNGER BROTHER
(shouts back at his brother)
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SO MEAN YOU KNOW!

The older brother goes back to the spinning and the younger one angrily runs away to get more wood. They are both very pissed off.

Time passes. We see compilation shots of the older brother breaking spindles. Getting close but failing. Each time getting more and more pissed off. The younger brother stacks more and more wood.

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
The sun is starting to set now. The older brother is completely full of sweat. His hands are bleeding. The spindle looks more like a red stick now. He has been at this for hours without any success. His younger brother comes up with a last bunch of wood and drops it on a pile that is quite big now and should be enough even for a massive bonfire.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Stop it! Why can't we just swim there! I've been collecting wood the whole day. The sun is already going down and you're just sitting there spinn...(interrupted)

OLDER BROTHER
(completely freaks out and screams like a monster)
You know what! FINE THEN. LET'S GO SWIMMING!!!

He rushes to his younger brother like a monster that is going to attack him, pulls him up by the arm with his bloody hand.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Ouch! Stop it! You're hurting me!

He drags his younger brother like a maniac. The younger brother falls around as he can't get a good stance on his good leg. The older brother drags the younger one into the ocean and throws him in the shallow waves. The younger brother lands completely unprepared with his face in the sand and foamy water.

OLDER BROTHER
(still shouting like a monster)
SWIM! GO!!! MOM AND DAD ARE WAITING FOR YOU! GOOO!!! (points at the ship and kicks the water at his younger brother)

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying, soaked in water)
NO! I DON'T WANT TO. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

The younger brother quickly gets out of the water and limps past his older brother as fast as he can. The younger one tries to bump/hit the older one as he passes but as he does the older brother retaliates and bumps the younger one over AGAIN.

OLDER BROTHER
IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO GO SWIM SO DON'T GO RUNNING AWAY LIKE A BABY NOW!

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying)
I HATE YOUU!!!! I HATE YOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!

The younger brother throws the older one with sand as he gets up a second time. He is covered in water and sand, all over his body. He limps towards the cave.

OLDER BROTHER
(talks to himself)
Swim? Don't be stupid you dumbass.

The older brother walks back to his spindle position. He angrily throws away the previous coconut shell. He rips another coconut's hairs off and ruffles it. He starts spinning again. We see the focus in his eyes. He is really putting in his last chance now. He starts slow and slowly builds up his speed.

We see a shot of his eyes again. They seem to get red and watery. He looks down, a little bit of smoke is coming out again. He starts going faster. The blood from his hands is running down the spindle again.

We see a shot of his eyes again. They are very watery now. He is clearly starting to cry. He QUICKLY takes his one hand off to wipe the tears from eyes, he leaves blood on his face but at least he can see more clearly again.

The smoke is building up. He is spinning faster and faster. But for some reason he is crying more and more, it is starting to run down his face.

He is spinning at his fastest pace! The smoke is there but it just isn't catching a light. He is crying uncontrollably now. THE SPINDLE BREAKS. He quickly reaches behind him but they are all snapped. He has used them all up.

OLDER BROTHER
(while crying uncontrollably)
NO. NO! NO!

He picks up the smoking coconut and blows on it and keeps it guarded from the wind as much as he can. He blows, and blows, and blows. It dies out completely.

OLDER BROTHER
(screaming in tears)
Aaaaaargggghhhhhh!!! WHY!!! WHY WHY!!!

He has lost it completely. He kicks and throws everything around him away. The same way a kid would throw a TV game controller at the wall after losing at a game.

OLDER BROTHER
WHYYYYY!!!!!!!

He falls down, with his head in his hands on the sand. He starts crying a lot.

OLDER BROTHER
(this time whispering through the snot and slime on his lips, he cries. Snickering as he cries)
Why?? Whyyy yyy yyy.

He pulls himself together and looks up. Still crying though. He looks back at the cave. He stares at it for a while. SUDDENLY HE REALISES WHAT HE HAS DONE. He jumps up and runs towards the cave. Crying as he runs.

He reaches the cave in a rush, looking around. Trying to find his brother. He lifts pieces of rubble, not knowing where his brother is.

He pulls away a piece of wood that seems to have been placed there as a shield. His brother is sitting in a ball, facing the corner. Snickering from the crying, wiping his face with his arms.

OLDER BROTHER
(holds his brother from behind)
I'm sorry! Here I am.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(looks around at his brother while crying)
NO! LEAVE ME ALONE YOU MONSTER!!!

The younger brother tries to squeeze himself against the wall as much as possible to get away from his brother grabbing him. Like a dog backed up in a corner. Regardless the older brother still grabs the younger brother and pulls him closer.

OLDER BROTHER
(crying)
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorryyyy!!!! (calms down, now almost whispers) I'm sorry (snickers as he cries). I'm...so....oo....ryyy!! I'm soo...sooo...oooo...rryyyy...

The older brother is holding the younger one. They are both crying a lot.

OLDER BROTHER
(battles through the tears)
I'll never do that again. I promise...

The younger brother turns around. They are both crying. We move away with the camera. They are in each other's arms, in the corner of the dark cave.

FADE OUT:

(A black screen pauses for a bit to give the audience some time)

EXT. BEACH - MORNING

OLDER BROTHER
On your feet soldier!

The younger brother wakes up, extremely confused. The older brother is standing above him, looking at him. The older brother is dressed in army clothes made from leaves and items lying around. He has drawn a thin moustache on his lips with mud. The younger brother looks to his sides, both sides DIY puppets are propped up in the sand. They are made from scraps on the island as well.

OLDER BROTHER
DO I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF AGAIN! ON. YOU. FEE...

The younger brother jumps up in the sand. Now standing with his limp leg in between the other to wooden soldiers. He is still asleep, definitely not awake yet, but quite frightened-awake from the event.

The older brother slowly looks at the soldiers next to his younger brother. The younger brother follows his gaze. Both the wooden soldiers have their wooden arms propped up, in a typical "roger that" stance with their hands above their eyebrows. After gazing at the wooden puppet's stance, the older brother looks at the younger brother with a raised eyebrow. The younger brother doesn't understand what he needs to do, he looks to the soldier next to him again and then NOTICES THE STANCE. He props up his hand as well. They now look like 3 soldiers ready to take on a speech.

OLDER BROTHER
(walking up and down the line like a sergeant, with a fake "army sergeant" accent)
Yesterday, our plans failed. We were not prepared. We were not ready. We weeeere weak! Crying like little babies. You babies want to go home to your Mammas!!!

The older brother suddenly stops his pacing up and down and looks one of the wooden puppets dead in the face. Breathing against the wooden puppet's face.

OLDER BROTHER
Is that a tear I see private Woody?

He just stares at the wooden puppet, waiting for it to reply. We see the younger brother giggling next to them.

OLDER BROTHER
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE! (moves his face to his younger brother, now breathing in his face)

The younger brother doesn't reply to the question, but immediately swallows his giggles, repositions his stance and looks past the older brother (as a soldier won't look the sergeant in the eyes)

OLDER BROTHER
Is there something wrong with your ears soldier?

The younger brother is slightly confused, he lowers his hand to touch his ear to feel if something is wrong with it.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No?

OLDER BROTHER
Well then why aren't you answering my question, I said: do you think this is a joke!?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No! (readies his hand in the stance again)

OLDER BROTHER
NO WHO?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No Sir!

OLDER BROTHER
NO, SERGEANT!

YOUNGER BROTHER
No sergeant!

The older brother walks up and down the line of soldiers again.

OLDER BROTHER
Gather at the meeting pit, pronto!

The younger brother is confused, looking around (he doesn't know where this "meeting pit" is). The older brother leads the way towards the meeting pit which is just a few feet away. It is a sand pit, framed on the ground with big wooden branches. The area around it is also decorated and cleaned up. It looks like a DIY meeting room. The older brother stops in front of the sand box in a stance with his chin up and his eyes closed. Waiting for the others.

The younger brother slips as he runs in the sand, realising he needs to be there. He reaches the meeting pit and stands ready like a soldier on the opposite side of the older brother. The older brother opens his eyes, looking at the younger brother.

OLDER BROTHER
Who do you think you are? You want to fight this war alone? WHERE ARE YOUR COMRADES SOLDIER?

The younger brother points to the two wooden puppet soldiers left behind.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Get. Your. Comrades. Here. NOW!

The younger brother dashes back to the two wooden soldiers. He battles to pull the mounting sticks out of the ground but eventually gets them out. He carries them back, they are basically the size of him, so carrying them is not easy. Many of their "parts" fall off in the process. He reaches the meeting pit with them. Props them in the sand and stands next to them. Back in his soldier stance again. All 3 soldiers are now ready for the meeting.

OLDER BROTHER
Like I said. Last night was a disaster. Our plan failed. So I have...

He gets interrupted by the middle puppet's arm breaking loose and hanging limp, no longer in the soldier stance. The younger brother looks back at his older brother, not expecting he needs to do anything. The older brother doesn't continue talking and stares at his younger brother. The younger brother REALISES he needs to fix it. He grabs the puppets's wooden arm next to him and repositions it in an army stance (like you would with a puppet show).

OLDER BROTHER
...I have figured out a new plan for us.

The older brother picks up a long stick next to him and starts drawing in the middle of the sand pit. We as viewers are now looking at it from top down, like a map.

OLDER BROTHER
If our intel is correct. We capsized our sailboat around here somewhere (places a DIY sailboat miniature on the map). So that means, we can't be too far from this location (places an island miniature close to the sailboat). The ship we saw yesterday, is probably one of the ships along the famous cruise ship course that we passed on our way here (places a collection of DIY cruise ships on a line going past the sailboat and the island). Can anyone tell me what that means?

Looks up, waiting for one of the soldiers to respond. He looks at the younger brother. The younger brother looks at the wooden soldier next to him (as if it will say something).

OLDER BROTHER
Fine, I'll tell you what it means! We saw the big cruise ship on the sailboat 3 days before we capsized (he draws 3 lines in the sand). We have been on the island for 6 days (adds 4 more lines in the sand). How many days does that give us?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(excited to know the answer to this one!)
9 days!

OLDER BROTHER
Correct! That means, we have a big chance of another ship passing our location in another 9 days (rides one of the cruise ships past the island to explain the idea visually). Therefore, we need to learn how to make fire! If we can build a fire large enough, to make enough smoke (he puts a bunch of roughed coconut hairs onto the island, they look like smoke) we should be able to signal to our allies that we are in need of help (stands upright from the pit, done explaining)

OLDER BROTHER
Is that clear?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yes Sir!

The older brother looks at the younger brother with a dropped eyebrow!

OLDER BROTHER
Sergeant! Yes sergeant!

Sound Design: Fun music starts playing.

EXT. COMPILATION SHOTS
(the order is not important)

They improve their camp/cave.

They START building a raft.

They practise making fire (older brother succeeds, younger brother keeps failing).

Younger brother's leg heals, they remove the bandages.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
We see the older brother tie the yellow plastic from the life raft to a wooden "4-shaped" frame. He just finished the last knot. We see a wide shot of them completing a wooden raft. The yellow plastic now forms the sail. They are on the side of the beach, the wooden raft is on the sand. The raft is about 2x2 meters wide, not very big, but big enough for them to sit on. The older brother has just completed tying a last knot.

OLDER BROTHER
(talks to himself)
Haha damn, at least we'll get an A+ for ambition.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What is ambition?

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
Nothing, never mind...Do you think this lady is ready for the SEVEN SEAS! (acts like a pirate when saying it)

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeaaaah! (punches in the air) Now we can go home!

OLDER BROTHER
(sad and surprised at the comment)
No no no. This is just a toy. We can go out and have some fun in the water but we can't go out too far with it.

The older brother pushes it into the shallow waves, enough to get it floating. He holds onto it. The younger brother is still watching from outside the water.

OLDER BROTHER
(looks back at his brother on the beach)
I'm allowed to take one passenger with me you know.

The younger brother realises what this means and rushes into the water to join. He helps push the raft.

OLDER BROTHER
No man. Get on top, I'll push us in.

The younger brother gets on to the raft. While he gets on we see the logs look very loose. It doesn't look safe.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Should it be like this? (wiggles a loose log)

OLDER BROTHER
Yeah don't worry about that. We'll be fine. I promise.

The older brother pushes the raft even more and they float away.

OLDER BROTHER
Hand me that big thing next to you.

The older brother points at a DIY rudder on the other side of the younger brother. The younger brother passes it to the older brother, moving the big thing over his head. The older brother slips it into the base of the raft.

OLDER BROTHER
(army voice again)
Okay, soldier. Are, you, ready!?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(jumps ready in soldier stance)
Yes Sergeant!

OLDER BROTHER
We're now going to practise the basics of sailing, you got that?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yes Sergeant!

OLDER BROTHER
Okay! Task one, lick your finger!

The younger brother just looks at him very confused.

OLDER BROTHER
I said, lic...

The younger brother knows this line, he quickly licks the inside of his finger like an icecream.

OLDER BROTHER
No man! Put it in your mouth!

The younger brother's finger gets lost in his mouth. He has literally just copied what his brother says. So he stands there with his finger in his mouth, awkwardly.

OLDER BROTHER
Okay, now take it out and stick your hand in the air.

He takes out his finger, but sticks his other hand in the air. Simultaneously.

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs at this)
Haha no man, stick your wet finger in the air!

The younger brother quickly switches the hand in the air. He is now standing upright with his wet finger pointing straight up at the sky.

OLDER BROTHER
What do you feel?

YOUNGER BROTHER
A wet finger sergeant!

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
What do you feel on the wet finger soldier?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Uhmmm...wind Sergent!

OLDER BROTHER
VERY NICE! Which way is the wind going?

The older brother drops his hand a bit, he looks around him. He is trying to figure out which way the wind is blowing.

YOUNGER BROTHER
That way Sergeant!

The older brother wets his finger, puts it in the air, keeps it there for a while.

OLDER BROTHER
You are correct solier! Now, move the sail so that it catches the wind.

The younger brother takes the sail "4-frame" and swings it around it's axis until it catches wind. As soon as it catches wind it wants to pull out of the younger brother's hands AND the raft suddenly picks up speed.

OLD MAN
Verrry niiice. Now tie that rope to the base.

The older brother points at a rope that is hanging off the edge of the main sail. The younger brother keeps the main sail steady with his hip and then tries the rope to the raft.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm done Sergeant.

OLDER BROTHER
Is it tight?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yes Sergeant!

OLDER BROTHER
Super, super tight?

The younger brother gives the knot another hard pull to make sure.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yes Sergeant!

OLDER BROTHER
Good work Solier. That is the basics of wind. Now, come here.

He taps on a spot next to the rudder where he is sitting. The younger brother sits right on it.

OLDER BROTHER
Okay, take this (he gives his brother the rudder's handle). This works in reverse, okay? If you point it left, the raft goes right. If you point it right, the raft goes left. You got that?

The younger brother nods yes frantically as he is already looking forward and angling the rudder.

OLDER BROTHER
Wow, looks like you have pirate blood in you hey!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah! Like Captain Jack Sparrow!

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
Like Captain Jack Sparrow...

They sail away.

EXT. OCEAN - NOON
They are floating on the ocean, not far from the beach though.

OLDER BROTHER
Okay, that's far enough.

The older brother ties loose the main sail, which causes it to flap parallel with the wind, therefore not creating any force anymore. He also drops the hand made anchor (a big rock on vines). The older brother sits down next to the younger brother holding the rudder.

OLDER BROTHER
You can let go of that now, it won't make a difference anymore.

Younger brother let's go very slowly, watching if the raft might suddenly fall over or something.

YOUNGER BROTHER
But...

He doesn't continue his question.

OLDER BROTHER
But?

YOUNGER BROTHER
But why can't we go out there (points to the horizon) and find Mom and Dad.

OLDER BROTHER
This TOY we're on will never make it out there. It will break. There are SEA MONSTERS out there (tickles his brother under the arm)...besides. WE are the ones waiting, for the ship...remember our plan?

YOUNGER BROTHER
So we can use it to drive to the ship. That means I don't need to learn how to make fire anymore?

OLDER BROTHER
No, I still think the smoke is a better idea. This thing isn't very trustworthy. But we'll see when the day comes though.

EXT. OCEAN - LATER THAT DAY
The sun is starting to set. They are still floating close to where we last saw them. The older brother is sleeping/tanning on the raft. The younger one is sitting on the side splashing his feet in the water. SUDDENLY we see a shark fin swim past.

Sound Design: The music suddenly becomes serious, and then hangs tensely.

The younger brother looks up at the fin, not sure if what he saw was really something. He has stopped splashing his feet and is now watching the location he saw the fin. A TINY TIP OF A FIN COMES UP AND SWIMS PAST. The younger brother jumps up out of the water!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Shark! Shark! Shark!!

The younger brother backs up against the older brother. The older brother wakes up in a quick fright. And looks around.

OLDER BROTHER
What?

YOUNGER BROTHER
A SHARK! THERE! (points at where it was)

The older brother quickly stands up, holding onto the "4-frame" and peers over to see if he can see anything in the water. The younger brother is holding onto his leg.

OLDER BROTHER
Are you sure? I don't see anything?

YOUNGER BROTHER
YES! It was right there!

The older brother breaks loose from the younger brother holding onto him. He walks closer to the edge. He scans the water. Then he sees something below him. He gets on his knees on the edge of the raft. He reaches down with his one hand on the edge of the raft to support himself looking into the water. The younger brother is watching intensely from behind...SUDDENLY something grabs the older brother's hand and pulls his arm downwards.

OLDER BROTHER
Aaaaahhh!

YOUNGER BROTHER
AAAaaHHHHH!!

OLDER BROTHER
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!

YOUNGER BROTHER
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

The younger brother's face is FULL OF FEAR. The older brother lifts his hand up in the air!...IT IS WRAPPED IN GREY SEAWEED.

OLDER BROTHER
I THINK THE SEAWEED GOT MEEEE!!!

The younger brother stares at his hand, with his mouth wide open but not screaming. He pauses for a bit to take in the joke.

YOUNGER BROTHER
THAT'S NOT FUNNYYYYYYYY!!!!!

OLDER BROTHER
(walks to his brother to give him a hug)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (he can't help laughing while saying this)

His younger brother bumps the older brother's arm away, refusing the hug, and turns his body to face away from the older brother's position.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I hate you!

OLDER BROTHER
(swallowing his laugh now)
Oh whatever. It was just a joke. I love you (ruffles his brother's hair). We should be getting back anyways.

The older brother readies the sail and sits down next to his backward facing brother to take the rudder's handle.

OLDER BROTHER
You know what, just to say I'm sorry, we can come fishing tomorrow.

YOUNGER BROTHER
...From here, from the boat?

OLDER BROTHER
Yeah, exactly...but there's a catch...

The younger brother looks at the older brother.

OLDER BROTHER
We can only come if you get a fire going.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Oh come on! You know I can't do it. I'm not strong enough! (he points at his biceps as if they actually play a role)

OLDER BROTHER
Oh yeah. You're right...

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah exactly. I can't.

OLDER BROTHER
Ooooooh well. So much for catching all these colourful fish. And the shark! Oh man, would've loved to see you catch that bad boy.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Oh come oooon! Don't be like that. We can come fish, and then do the fire afterwards.

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
No no no, what does Mom always say...

YOUNGER BROTHER
(moans well repeating the rhyme)
"Chores come FIRST, and then we PLAY, or else my TOYS will walk AWAY..."

The older brother ruffles his younger brother's hair. The younger brother slaps his hand away.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Leave me alone.

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs)
I love you too.

They sail back to the beach, but as they sail back, the younger brother looks over his shoulder to the area where the shark was seen. Something isn't right.

Sound Design: The music has to sound very ominous as the younger brother looks back at the area where he saw the shark.

The sun sets.

INT. CAVE - MORNING
We hear the sound of a spindle spinning on wood. Then it snaps.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(frustrated)
Oh come onnn...

The older brother wakes up, we are looking through his point of view. He looks around him. He sees his younger brother off to the side trying his best to get a fire started.

OLDER BROTHER
(half asleep, eyes still closed)
Morning...Dad should promise you a fishing trip next time you need to clean your room.

The older brother opens his eyes and looks at his brother.

OLDER BROTHER
You winning there soldier?

No response.

INT. CAVE - LATER

OLDER BROTHER
Take a break soldier. You're not gonna get it right if you're so tired out.

The younger brother stops, but throws the spindle down in frustration.

OLDER BROTHER
Let's take a walk? We need to find some rods if you want to go fish anyways.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No.

OLDER BROTHER
No what? No you don't want to go for a walk or no you don't want to go fishing anymore?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No. I want to make the fire.

The older brother smiles at his younger brother. He then stands up and gathers some items for the walk (water etc).

OLDER BROTHER
Okay. Anyways. I'm going for a walk.

The older brother walks out of the cave.

OLDER BROTHER
Don't go anywh...

He looks back at the younger brother in the cave when saying this. The younger brother is already back at it, spinning the spindle. The older brother just smiles and walks on.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
We see the older brother walking on the beach. He is already carrying a few items he has picked up. Two big hollow logs, a few sticks and some extra empty water bottles.

He stops to pick up a stick. He takes the end and bends it inwards, to see how far the stick will go before it breaks. It creates quite a loop without breaking. He waves it in the air to check its elasticity.

OLDER BROTHER
(looks up at the sky)
Check out this one dad.

HE TURNS TOWARDS THE OCEAN. He acts as if the stick is a fishing rod. He "reels in the line a bit". He acts like he snaps back the reel's leaver. He pulls it back and swings it forward.

OLDER BROTHER
Zzzzzzzzzzzz.....gloemp!

While holding out the "rod" in the air, he NOTES SOMETHING in the distance, washed up on the beach. It has the shape of a dolphin. His face lights up in an "oh wow" manner.

He puts down all the items and runs to the dolphin. IT STINKS but is very beautiful though (imagine if you'd have to see a dolphin up close like this for the first time). He slowly investigates it while keeping his nose closed with his one hand. He looks to the ocean and back at the dolphin. Again at the ocean. Again at the dolphin. He frowns. He walks around it, he notices a bloody area under the dolphin, at the back. He pushes it a bit to try and roll the dolphin over. It's very heavy. He decides to hold his breath and uses both hand to push with all his force. He gets the dolphin rolled over. We see a GROSS BIG HOLE in the dolphin. IT STICKS even more now. He gets a fright at the scene and falls back on his arms in the sand. You can very clearly see the BITE MARKS around the wound. He just looks at it a bit with his head sideways, as if the scene is a hot fire burning his face. He notices something in the flesh, on the rim of the bite mark. He moves closer to see it more clearly. It is a small white thing. He picks up a shell next to him and uses it to scratch the item out of the wound. A shark tooth drops on the sand. He picks it up. We see a close up shot of the shark tooth in his hand.

INT. CAVE - LATER
The younger brother is very much focussed on spinning the spindle, he is at a fast pace right now. The older brother enters the cave area.

OLDER BROTHER
Afternoon soldier. You still at it hey?...Check what I found, a shark tooth! They should make great hooks to fish with. (holds it in the air to show his brother)

No response from the younger brother who is busy focusing on the spindle.

OLDER BROTHER
I found a dead dolphin as well! I'll take you out to show you tomorrow. (he holds out the two big hollow logs he has been carrying) I also got these bad boys, I'll show yo...

YOUNGER BROTHER
Look look look!!

The older brother looks to his younger brother, a bit of smoke is coming out of the coconut hairs. The older brother walks forward. The older brother just stands and watches, not interfering with the student. The younger brother goes faster and faster but eventually he starts getting tired and gives up all of a sudden.

OLDER BROTHER
No, no! GO! Quickly, you're almost there!

The younger brother quickly starts spinning again. He is pumping out every bit of energy he has. The smoke gets thicker, and thicker, and thicker...WE SEE A FAINT RED GLOW.

OLDER BROTHER
There it is! Grab it quick!
The younger brother picks up the coconut and starts blowing softly. The older brother looks around, picks up more coconut hairs and passes it to his brother. The younger brother places it on top of his smoking batch. He blows and blows, the smoke becomes thicker and thicker...IT LIGHTS! Flames come from the coconut hairs.

He puts it down as his older brother hands him very thin twigs, then bigger and bigger sticks.

OLDER BROTHER
Nice! Give me one (lifts his hand in the air for a high five)

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm the fire king!!! MOHAHAHAHA!!!

OLDER BROTHER
Indeed you are! Indeed you are! (ruffles his brother's hair)

The younger brother falls back on the sand. Completely exhausted now. We move away from them, time passes, the night sets in and they are now sitting next to that same fire.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT
The older brother is sitting next to the fire. The younger brother is lying by himself off to the side.

OLDER BROTHER
Ey sleepy head. Food is ready.

The younger brother slowly wakes up and makes his way to the fire. The older brother hands him a stick with some cooked bananas and coconut on it.

INT. CAVE - LATER
They are still sitting around the fire. The younger brother finishes his meal. Around them are remains of the meal and empty water bottles. The older brother is busy with the two heavy logs he collected earlier. He is spinning a sharp rock on one of them, trying to make a whole.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What is that?

OLDER BROTHER
What is this? WHAT IS THIS! This my dear friend, is magic.

The younger brother just frowns. He doesn't understand. The older brother finishes making the hole.

OLDER BROTHER
There we go. This one is yours.

The younger brother takes it, but has no idea what to do with it.

OLDER BROTHER
Now, in theory...

The older brother repositions the log like you would place a didgeridoo. He starts blowing into the hole. We hear a weird, awkward blowing sound. He keeps trying. He stops and wets his lips with his tongue. The younger brother is still confused, not sure what is going on. The older brother starts blowing again. We still just hear a wet blowing noise. THEN, hints of success come though. More. And More. And FINALLY we hear the beautiful rumble of something similar to a didgeridoo.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(super excited and amazed)
Ah ha haha!!! That is some awesoooome. Do mine also!

The younger brother hands the older brother his log.

OLDER BROTHER
No that's yours. You do your own one.

YOUNGER BROTHER
But I don't know how.

OLDER BROTHER
Here I'll show you (he repositions his younger brother's log correctly). Ok, wet your lips a little bit.

The younger brother wets it A LOT, making sure to cover every corner.

OLDER BROTHER
Ok, now, it is not going to be easy. So don't give up early, alright?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Alright!

OLDER BROTHER
Place your mouth on this hole and blow into it.

The younger brother places his mouth on the hole and blows, but it doesn't make the didgeridoo sound at all. He really tries hard, but it isn't working.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(getting a little upset)
I can't do it, I'm not strong enough...

OLDER BROTHER
No man! It's not about being strong (he paused to think for a bit). Try...try pouting your lips.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What is pouting?

OLDER BROTHER
Like kissing (he shows an example). Make like you want to kiss the log.

The younger brother giggles at his older brother's face, but then kisses the log. Just that, kisses it and keeps his lips on it.

OLDER BROTHER
Ok, now blow as hard as you can!

He blows. THE DIDGERIDOO SOUND POPS OUT for a second. The younger brother pulls back from excitement. He looks at his older brother. Then the younger brother takes a deep breath, wets his lips again, pouts his lips and goes back for another blow.

A wide shot shows the two of them sitting under the stars battling, blowing their didgeridoos and having a great time. Most of the time we just hear wet blowing sounds, but now and then a didgeridoo sound comes through and they congratulate each other.

EXT. BEACH - MORNING

YOUNGER BROTHER
On your feet army man!

This time the younger brother has woken up first and is playing army general now. The older brother wakes up from the noise and tries to get his eyes to focus on his brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I saaaaaiiddd... (purposefully pausing to copy what his brother previous did)

OLDER BROTHER
(slowly stands up into soldier stance, not as excited about it as his brother was)
Morning Sergeant!

(Throughout this scene, the younger brother battles to stop giggling about the whole situation)

YOUNGER BROTHER
(walks up and down)
Where are your friends?!

OLDER BROTHER
(still so asleep that he is basically standing with his eyes closed)
Uhmmm. I don't know sergeant. Woody went out drinking last night and Planky left with a woman. I haven't seen them both since.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(really battling to hold his giggles now!)
Okay. That is okay. What is the plan today? (he immediately continues with the following line as well, clearly getting the idea wrong) I saaaaid, what is the plan today?

OLDER BROTHER
Uhmmm....I don't know sergeant?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Fishing! Fishing is the plan today!

OLDER BROTHER
Oh yes yes, right. I forgot. Sorry sergeant.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Soooo...I'll race you to the boat! (drops his army gear/outfit and starts gunning for the raft)

OLDER BROTHER
Wait, wait, wait. We need to get some worms first! But before that, let me just get my first banana in for the morning...Where did all your energy come from this morning?

The scene starts fading away as the older brother takes a big yawn and walks to get a banana.

Sound Design: The sound gets softer and softer as they continue their conversation.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm just ready! I'm going to catch that shark today!

OLDER BROTHER
(softly talks to himself)
To be honest, I hope you don't.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm gonna catch it. Just like this. In the mouth! And pull it onto the raft (he hooks his own mouth with his finger and acts like he pulls himself forward)

FADE OUT:

EXT. BEACH - NOON
The older brother is at the raft. They have packed what seems to be a lot of fishing gear. Food for snacking on. Long fishing poles. Thin vines twirled into rope for fishing line. The older brother is busy TYING THEIR DIDGERIDOOS TO THE RAFT. It looks nice, like a little detail on the raft. The younger brother runs up to the raft with a hand full of something.

OLDER BROTHER
Did you get some?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, they're gross!

The younger brother hands the older brother a hand full of worms.

OLDER BROTHER
Niccccce. You might just get that shark of yours with these bad boys.

They pack everything tightly on the raft. They head out.

EXT. OCEAN - LATER

YOUNGER BROTHER
Right here?

The younger brother is standing with his hand ready to roll the anchor rock into the ocean.

OLDER BROTHER
Yup! This is good.

The younger brother rolls the rock into the ocean. They loosen the main sail. They get comfortable on the raft and reposition everything to have a comfortable fishing day. They both put on big straw hats that they have made.

OLDER BROTHER
Ok, you ready for this?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah yeah yeah!

OLDER BROTHER
Pass me your rod over there (points to a rod behind the younger brother)

The younger brother passes the rod to his older brother.

OLDER BROTHER
Now, you're going to have to put one of these fatties on your hook (shows the younger brother a handful of worms)

YOUNGER BROTHER
Noooo. Why? I don't need them.

OLDER BROTHER
Well, you have to give the fish something worth fighting for.

YOUNGER BROTHER
But they don't even like worms. The ones we have at home eat those soft flaky things.

OLDER BROTHER
Yeah but these are different fish than the ones we have at home. These fish loooove fatties like these.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No but that is gross. I don't wanna do it.

OLDER BROTHER
Haha ok fine, fine. I'll do the first one for you.

They get the rods ready and throw them in.

EXT. COMPILATION SHOTS

Time passes without them really catching anything.

They take naps.

They blow their didgeridoos.

They tickle and prank each other with the worms and such.

FADE OUT:

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
They are both sitting, opposite sides of the raft. Very calmly, almost bored looking. The older brother is not fishing, but just lying on his back in the sun with his eyes closed, DANGLING HIS FEET AROUND IN THE WATER. We see a shot of his dangling feet from BELOW THE SURFACE. The younger brother is sitting with his head on his knees. His feet are up against his body. He is watching his line very closely in the water, waiting for a bite any time.

OLDER BROTHER
Only about three more days hey. I'm glad you finally got that fire of yours going.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(mumbling a bit because of his jaw on his knees)
Yeah, but I'm still not as fast as you.

OLDER BROTHER
Ah no worries, I'll make the fire for us anyways. So we should be fine.

As the older brother says the above like, the younger one sees something glitter past in the water below him where his line disappears into the water. He pauses a bit, and closely focuses his eyes, wondering what he has just seen...

Sound Design: Something is ominous.


OLDER BROTHER
I must say, you're one committed fisherman. You might just end up catching that big bad shark you wanted so badly.

The younger brother sees it again. It looked like a shark fin this time. He puts his rod next to him and stands up to get a closer look.

OLDER BROTHER
Now that you mention it, I wonder what is the biggest...

HE GETS INTERRUPTED.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(sees the fin swim past, going under the raft towards his brother)
SHARK! SHARK!!! (drops everything in the water and starts running towards his brother)

The older brother looks over his shoulder, wondering what the younger brother is so frightened about. THE NEXT MOMENT THE OLDER BROTHER GETS PULLED OFF THE RAFT BY HIS LEGS. The older brother immediately turns around and tries to grab a hold of the raft but misses it. The younger brother runs to the older brother's side of the raft. He doesn't know what to do. The older brother is fighting in the water, clearly the shark has him by his leg, pulling, dragging and fighting. The younger brother turns around, grabs all the food on the raft and throws it to the side, away from the scene, to hopefully make the shark go for the bait. It doesn't really work. The older brother is now trying to kick/punch the shark to hopefully fight it off. The younger brother picks up one of the didgeridoos, trying to hit the shark, but at the same time he can't really get any hits in because he is afraid of hitting his brother. THE OLDER BROTHER GETS LOOSE. He has been pulled a bit away from the raft, so the younger brother lowers his didgeridoo for the older brother to grab on to. The older brother grabs on to the didgeridoo and the younger one pulls him with all his force. The younger brother slips while trying to drag his brother to the raft. The older brother reaches the raft and tries to climb in. The younger one is pulling the older one in whatever way he can, but his efforts aren't helping much. Eventually the older brother is on the raft and drags himself and his leg to the middle of the raft. No one wants to be on the side of the raft now. HIS WOUND IS VERY BAD. A big gash in his one leg. The raft is now covered in blood at the side he got in. The younger brother quickly takes off his shirt and wraps it around his older brother's wound. He doesn't do a very good job but he is trying his best. The older brother takes over, fixes the shirt, and ties it much harder than the older brother can.

OLDER BROTHER
(in pain)
Give me the rod.

The younger brother passes him the fishing rod. The older brother snaps a small piece (about 30cm) off of the rob, then uses it to wrap the shirt around so that he can turn the stick to add pressure to the shirt.

OLDER BROTHER
(in pain)
Okay. We're fine. Get the sail.

The older brother drags himself to the anchor and pulls it up as fast as possible. The younger brother gets the main sail ready by firstly sticking his wet finger in the air and checking the wind direction. The older brother then moves towards the rudder. They start sailing to the beach.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
They reach the beach. The older brother gets off the raft as soon as it is safe. He walks through the water, dragging the one leg behind while splashing off all the blood with his hand.

OLDER BROTHER
(without looking backwards)
Pull in the raft.

The younger brother gets to work pulling in the raft which is not an easy task for someone of his age/strength.

The older brother continues to the cave. He reaches the cave, then frantically searches for what was left of the med kit from the previous use. It is a hard search, as it isn't something they used often. He finds it, safely packed away somewhere. He zips it open, not caring what falls out. He searches it empty. The younger brother is now running in from behind (the older brother doesn't see it)

OLDER BROTHER
Where is it?!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Where is what?

OLDER BROTHER
Where is the bandage we used for your leg?

The younger brother helps searching, remembering they placed it somewhere. They both search for a bit, eventually the younger brother finds it hanging somewhere, left to dry.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(passes it to his older brother)
Here!

It is covered in dirt and old blood.

OLDER BROTHER
Dammit...(thinks for a bit)...go and wash it in the salt quickly.

YOUNGER BROTHER
The salt?

OLDER BROTHER
THE OCEAN! Go and rinse it clean in the ocean!

The younger brother runs off, the older brother sits down in a comfortable place. He starts clearing everything on his leg to check the wound. It doesn't look good. Ripped open quite badly. He stretches to grab onto a bottle of something from the med kit. He reads it, then throws it away. Takes another bottle, reads it, throws it away. There are no bottles left, he checks inside the medkit if anything is left in there, he then notices another bottle a bit further from him, he reaches over to grab it, reads it, keeps it. He grabs one of their drinking bottles next to him. He takes a stick lying close to him and bits on it. He opens the water bottle and forcefully squeezes the bottle to make the water jet at his wound and clean everything up. He bites on the stick and moans while doing this. He picks up another bottle and does the same. He then washes his hands with the bit left in the second bottle. Then he opens the medical bottle, and pours it over his wound. This burns so he moans and bites on his teeth even more. He puts down the GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS.
The younger brother returns with the bandage. As he comes closer he kicks over the GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS.

OLDER BROTHER
CAREFUL!!!!

The older brother picks up the GLASS BOTTLE OF ANTIBIOTICS and puts it upright again. We see it is basically empty, barely a few drops left.

The younger brother passes the bandage to the older brother. It is still very dirty looking.

OLDER BROTHER
(lifting the bandage to inspect it)
Was this really the best you could do?

YOUNGER BROTHER
It's not coming out.

The older brother takes the medical bottle again, tries to pour more on his wound but then realises it is finished.

OLDER BROTHER
DAMMIT!

The older brother picks up the medical kit again and searches for more antibiotics.

OLDER BROTHER
This isn't good, this isn't good.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What isn't good?

OLDER BROTHER
Nothing. Don't worry.

The older brother proceeds to quickly wrap the bandage around his wound. The process is very painful. He finally finishes tending to the wound and pushes the last bit of the bandage under the other's to keep it secure. He lies back onto the sand. Completely exhausted. The younger brother lies next to the older brother, placing his arms over his older brother to try and comfort him as best he can. They just lie there for a while. The older brother's eyes are closed, clearly trying to beat the pain and focus on something else. The younger brother keeps looking up at his brother's face and then down to the wound. Wondering if he is going to be okay. They lie here for a while.

OLDER BROTHER
Listen...(collects another breath)...you're going to have to be the sergeant for a bit okay?

The younger brother just looks at his older brother, but doesn't reply.

OLDER BROTHER
There are only three nights left, then the ship should hopefully pass us. Give or take. So until then you just need to get us some food and water. Also, you need to collect enough wood for the signal fire we need to make. I should be able to light it, but I can't walk around collecting wood with this leg. You got that?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, I got it.

They just keep holding each other.

OLDER BROTHER
It's not your fault you know...

The younger brother just softly starts crying, holding on to his older brother. The older brother puts his arm around the younger brother. They just lie in the cave.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

YOUNGER BROTHER
Hahahahaaaaa!

The older brother wakes up, he lifts his head to see what his younger brother is doing. The younger has just gotten it right to start the fire, so the younger brother is proud of his accomplishment. The older brother slowly drags himself to a wall to rest his body against so he can sit upright. He stops while doing this and looks at his leg, he softly touches it. He flinches from the pain. He looks at his younger brother. The younger brother has now piled up some sticks and has the fire going nicely. The younger one reaches to his side and puts something on a stick to roast. It looks like a fish, but also not, it is very smashed.

OLDER BROTHER
What is that?

YOUNGER BROTHER
(very proud)
It's a fish!

The older brother squints his eyes, finally he sees the fish amongst all the smashed meat.

OLDER BROTHER
What the heck did you do with it?

YOUNGER BROTHER
I caught it!

OLDER BROTHER
How?

YOUNGER BROTHER
With a rock.

OLDER BROTHER
With a rock?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, I threw it with a rock.

OLDER BROTHER
What?! You THREW a fish...with a ROCK?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah. And killed it.

OLDER BROTHER
How big was the damn rock?

The younger brother shows the size in the air, it was a BIG rock.

OLDER BROTHER
Holy shit hahaha. Good job. Never seen that one before.

EXT. CAVE - LATER
They feast on the food. A small bit of fish, bananas and coconuts. The older brother reaches to the side for a bottle of water, he finds a few, but they are all empty.

OLDER BROTHER
You don't have water by your side by any chance do you?

The younger brother has an "ah-ha" moment. He puts down his food, runs outside the cave, and runs back in with a palm tree leaf, stacked with all types of water bottles.

OLDER BROTHER
What on earth, when did you get all those?

YOUNGER BROTHER
I've been collecting them the whole day.

OLDER BROTHER
This afternoon?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, and this morning, and yesterday afternoon.

The older brother looks at the younger brother, squinting his eyes at him. Confused.

OLDER BROTHER
Wait, the shark bit me a few hours ago, right?

YOUNGER BROTHER
No.

OLDER BROTHER
Then when?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yesterday.

OLDER BROTHER
So the shark bit me, YESTERDAY?

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah.

OLDER BROTHER
WHAT!? I've been sleeping, for an entire day?!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yup! Almost thought you were dead at some po
int.

OLDER BROTHER
Damn, that's crazy.

The older brother sits back, to try and grasp the situation. The younger one sits back down and places a few bottles of water next to them. The older brother grabs one.

OLDER BROTHER
Well, good job on all the supplies. Clearly you know what you're doing.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Haha thanks. The fish was really cool! I slipped and bumped my knee on the rocks but it doesn't look too bad.

He displays his knee, it is just a little bloody but nothing serious. The scene cuts away while the younger brother keeps telling stories.

YOUNGER BROTHER
You should've seen! There was this big, scary, snake, fish thing. Between the rocks.

OLDER BROTHER
An eel?

YOUNGER BROTHER
I don't know. But it was so scary looking! It had sharp teeth. MANY sharp teeth. And it kept opening its mouth as if it wanted to bite me. So I took a stick, and I poked the stick in it's mouth.

OLDER BROTHER
No man! Don't hurt the animals if you're not going to eat them. They did nothing to you.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Yeah, I know, but this one was evil. It was going to bite me. I know it was....

(keeps telling stories)

EXT. BEACH - DAY
We see a close up of a stick spinning in the wood, then smoke coming up. The younger brother picks it up, blows on it, then it catches light. HE THROWS THE FLAMES TO THE OCEAN. We see a wide shot, he picks up another stick next to him, with coconut fluff, spits on his hands, then starts again. The remains of other successful fires lie in front of him washed up on the beach. He is clearly practicing making the fire. There is a ton of wood stacked next to him, clearly enough for the signal fire.

The younger brother walks into the cave to fetch some water. He picks up a bottle of water and starts drinking it. He walks to older brother to check on him. The older brother hears him coming and opens his eyes.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are you fine?

He doesn't look super asleep or tired.

OLDER BROTHER
I'm fine. But we need to check on my wound. Can you help quick?

The younger brother comes closer and helps lift his older brother against the wall to get him upright. He stands back. The older brother slowly starts opening the bandage. The blood has dried up a lot, so everything is cemented together. It is an awfully painful job to open the wound and the older brother keeps biting on his teeth while opening it. They finally get it open. It looks very, very bad. It is swollen, dirty, yellow puss is coming out of it.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Must it look like that?

OLDER BROTHER
(looks worried)
Yeah, don't worry. This is normal. It is just a bit dirty is all.

The older brother takes a bottle of water and again flushes the wound with it. It is not an easy task as it is extremely painful. He takes another and does it again.

OLDER BROTHER
Ok, take this (he passed the two empty bottles and the dirty bandage to his younger brother). Go to the ocean, clean the bandage, VERY WELL, and fill the two bottles with clean salt water.

The younger brother doesn't reply, just takes the items and runs off to the water. The older brother sits back against the wall. We watch him for a while. His eyes are starting to turn red and watery. He starts crying. Not from the pain, but from the situation. He doesn't react to the crying a lot. We see a tear roll down his face. He closes his eyes while it continues...

YOUNGER BROTHER
Here you go.

The younger brother just entered the cave, still a distance from the older brother. The older brother QUICKLY wipes off all the tears from his face and acts like he was doing something with the wound. The younger brother reaches him and holds the items out to him.

He takes one of the salt water bottles from his brother. He cleans his wound as much as he can. He then takes the second bottle of ocean water and does a good clean flush. He wipes off most of the water from his leg. He then takes the bandage and starts bandaging himself. He finishes, then sits back for a while.

OLDER BROTHER
Thanks champ! You're the best brother I have!

YOUNGER BROTHER
But I'm the only brother you have?

OLDER BROTHER
(laughs from his brother catching that)
Yeah, but IF I had more brothers, you would be my favourite.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Well, you're the best FRIEND I have.

OLDER BROTHER
(smiles at his brother, that was super sweet. The older brother's eyes turn red and watery)
Wellll (acting like it is a competition) you're the best EVERYTHING I have!

A tear rolls down the older brother's face.

OLDER BROTHER
Come here you!

The older brother grabs the younger brother to try and "nookie" his hair. The younger brother lets him, more than he really fights it. The older brother keeps crying, but at least he knows the younger one can't see it anymore.

EXT. CAVE - MORNING

YOUNGER BROTHER
On your feet soldier! (doesn't pause). Do I have to repeat myself, again, I said... (pauses purposefully, copying what his brother did but not doing it correctly)

The older brother wakes up from this. He looks up but doesn't get up.

OLDER BROTHER
(with eyes still quite closed)
Morning

YOUNGER BROTHER
Morning who?! MORING WHO?

The older brother doesn't respond. He is clearly not feeling well.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are you okay?

OLDER BROTHER
(speaks with a lot of effort)
I'm fine. How many days?

YOUNGER BROTHER
How many days?

The older brother doesn't reply. The younger one realises it.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Oh! Just one more day. One more sleep, tonight. Then they should be here tomorrow.

The older brother heard it, but doesn't show any response. He repositions himself. He battles to try and find something nice enough for a pillow. He keeps shifting around the leaves but they aren't working with him. Eventually the younger brother understands what is going on and quickly picks up a bunch of fresh leaves.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Here, lift your head quick.

The older brother doesn't open his eyes, but slightly lifts his head. The younger brother squeezes all the leaves under his brother's head.

OLDER BROTHER
(softly, not much energy)
Thank you.

The younger brother just sits, looking at his brother. He looks at the wound. It is very dirty and bad looking. He sits a while, looking at his brother. After a while, he bows down and gives the older brother a little soft hug. The older brother just puts his one hand over his little brother, indicating a hug back. The little brother walks outside of the cave. THE SKY IS GREY AND CLOUDY LOOKING, THE WIND IS SLOWLY PICKING UP. He stares out at the skies, then goes back inside. He starts preparing some food.

EXT. CAVE - LATER
The younger brother finishes chopping up a few pieces of coconut with a sharp rock. He places it on a plate. The plate is filled with all the food they have on the island, it looks like a great feast.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Soldier, I have breakfast for you!

No response from the older brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Do you want some food, I have some food for you here?

No response from the older brother. The younger brother places his hand on his older brother's rib cage, he feels that his brother is still breathing.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Well, I'm going to leave it for you here okay? It is on your left side.

The younger brother looks a little worried.

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
We see the younger brother's foot step on a rock. He is climbing somewhere, on the cave's wall side or something. He stops, turns around and looks at the ocean. He has a good view of the ocean, but a few tree tops are stopping his view from being clear enough to watch for a ship. THE SKIES ARE STILL GREY AND THE WIND IS BLOWING. He looks around to find another ledge he could try, he sees one in the distance. He climbs there. He stops, turns around, the view is much better, he can see the entire ocean without much obscuring his view. He looks around and just moves to a spot that is better for sitting purposes. He sits and lays his back against the wall. He pulls out a piece of hollow wood that he was carrying with him. He looks through it like a pirate's viewing glass.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(says in a fake army man voice)
Kgggggkk (radio sound). Captain, Captain, do you read me. Over.

Waits a few seconds.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Kgggggkk (radio sound). Roger. We have a clear view of the battlefield. Over.

Waits a few seconds.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Roger that Captain. Awaiting your...arrival! In the morning. Over and away.

He lowers his viewing glass and gives a soldier salute. He feels his bum is hurting. He lifts his one side and wipes some small rocks from under him. Then does the same with the other side. He sits back and looks at the ocean.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT
The fire is burning nicely. A fish and a crab are placed over the fire to cook. The younger brother is sitting near the fire. The older brother is still lying in the same spot. The breakfast plate is still there, with all the food untouched, flies and ants have started to gather around. A FLY OR TWO ARE WALKING AROUND ON THE OLDER BROTHER'S BANDAGE. The younger brother quickly lifts a palm leaf next to him and swabs the flies away.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Stop it now! I'm not going to say it again.

The younger one throws a few more pieces of wood onto the fire. He then continues building something. We can't see what it is, but he is crafting something out of leaves and pieces of scrap. After a while of battling and focusing he lifts the item into the air. It looks like a handheld radio, but made from pieces of leaves and sticks.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sergeant, I made us a walkie talkie! This way, I'll be able to give you updates tomorrow of the ship's...arrival.

He walks over to his older brother, who is on his side, facing the other way. The younger brother taps the older one on the shoulder and puts the walkie talkie in his view on the other side.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What do you think? I think it'll work!

No response from his older brother. The younger one leans over to see his older brother's face. The older brother is sweating a lot, his lips are dry and his face is quite pale.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Ah!? Are you okay!?

He quickly pulls his older brother onto his back and wipes the sweat off of his face. He puts his hand on his forehead to feel how hot he is.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Ah! Hold on!

The younger brother dashes off, grabs a bottle of water and some coconut hairs. He wets the coconut hairs a lot and then places it on his brother's forehead. The water runs all over his brother's face. He watches and we see the older brother kind of get some life, but this happens because he is trying to reposition his lips and tongue to catch some of the running water.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Wait, here! I've got some here!

The younger brother picks up the bottle of water he used for the coconut hairs. He also picks up his older brother's head a little bit. He slowly pours water into his brother's mouth. The older brother is drinking as if he has never had water in his life. The older brother turns his head away. The younger brother stops giving him water and lays his head back. The younger brother picks up the coconut hairs again and places it on his brother's forehead.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are you hungry? Some food?

No response. The younger brother grabs a banana that was close by and peels it open, he breaks off a half and offers it to his brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Here's some banana.

No response. The younger brother presses the banana piece against his older brother's lips, the older brother's mouth barely opens, he forcefully-tastes what is in front of his mouth, but then turns his head the other way with a "No" mumble.

YOUNGER BROTHER
You have to eat something, you haven't eaten anything for a long time...

The younger brother just sits there with the half of banana in his one hand, looking at the pile of breakfast food that hasn't been touched at all.

EXT. CAVE - LATER
The younger brother is tucking them in. He clears the sand around his older brother. He gets "in bed" and repositions the clothes and leafy blankets as good as he can. He throws another few pieces of wood onto the fire. Then he lays down. He just lies there for a bit. Repositions himself. Holds on to his older brother from behind. He just looks at his older brother for a while. He closes his eyes....He gives his brother a hard hug.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I love you...

No response.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
A loud lightning strikes. The younger brother's eyes open up in a fright, out of breath. He doesn't move. We see another blue light flash, but no sound. He quickly grabs/hugs his older brother and squints his eyes! The sound from the lightning only comes in after a few seconds, not very loud.

We hear the older brother moaning and he feels his brother shivering. The younger brother opens his eyes, surprised, not sure what is going on. He lifts himself on his one arm, and looks over his older brother's shoulder to his face. He is sweating a lot, shivering, and he looks very uncomfortable. He quickly pulls his brother onto his back, grabs the coconut hairs above them, wets it with the water bottle, and places it onto his brother's forehead.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are you okay?

No response. The younger brother shakes the older brother to get a response from him.

YOUNGER BROTHER
ARE YOU OKAY???

No response.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(getting worried)
What is going on with you? Talk to me, please!...

No response

YOUNGER BROTHER
Are you thirsty?

The younger brother tries to pour some water into his older brother's mouth, but he just chokes on it. THE YOUNGER BROTHER FREAKS OUT. He tilts the older brother to the side to make sure the water from the choking comes out easily. The older brother looks really, really sick.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I don't know what to do!? I don't know what you need. Tell me what you need. Please tell me!!!

He starts crying.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Tell me wha...
He gets a massive fright as a flash of blue light covers the cave. He quickly drops the water and falls down on his brother's chest, hugging him. He is crying and squinting his eyes closed as hard as possible, to prepare for the lightning strike coming. After a few seconds the soft lightning rumble comes in.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying and speaking softly)
Please. Tell me what you need. Pleaaase!....please...

The scene fades away as he keeps on crying on his brother's chest.

FADE OUT:

INT. CAVE - MORNING
The younger brother's eyes open quickly!

YOUNGER BROTHER
Today, it's today! We're going home!

The younger brother gets up from his older brother's chest where we last left him. The younger brother's eyes are red and full of dried tears. The older brother is just lying down. He is calm, just breathing.

The younger brother jumps up, he wipes the sand and dried tears out of his face as he walks/runs to the entrance. He stops at the entrance and looks up. The skies are VERY GREY AND CLOUDY and the wind is blowing a lot. He bows down and picks up a hand full of sand, he lets it blow away in the wind. His face seems confused. He looks at the massive log pile for the signal fire in the distance.

He runs towards the log pile. He feels around at all the logs, twigs, coconuts hairs etc. He seems really confused. He runs back to the cave.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sergeant. Weather news. It didn't rain, I don't know why. But that's good because our wood supply is still dry...The wind is scary bad though...

INT. CAVE - LATER
The younger brother places some more leaves nicely over the older brother. We see that he has prepared another breakfast meal and some bottles of water, all of this is placed next to the older brother lying down. The younger brother PICKS UP ONE OF THE WALKIE TALKIES.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Dooooo loooo beeep!

He acts like he turned a knob on the walkie talkie and it "turned on". He places it next to his brother's face on the ground.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sergeant. I'm heading out to watch. You have all the supplies you need next to you (points at them as if his brother sees him). You have food, water, the fire is good (he throws another stick on the fire). I'll come check on you later, okay? The radio is right in front of you, call me if you need me.

The younger brother picks up everything he packed for himself. This includes food, water, his viewing glass, a hat and a bunch of loose leaves. He runs out of the cave.

We see a close up shot of the walkie talkie next to the sick older brother.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY
The younger brother takes a last climb upwards to the ledge he found the previous day. THE CLOUDS ARE THICK AND GREY AND THE WIND IS BLOWING. He puts down all his goods, he places a bunch of leaves on the area where he wants to sit. He keeps them pressed down as he sits on them, trying to stop the wind from blowing them away. He positions himself correctly and picks up the walkie talkie.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sergeant, I'm in position. Over and away.

We see a close up shot of the older brother's face next to the radio.

The younger brother sits up, full of energy, picks up his viewing glass and looks out to the ocean. He scans it very well, but sees nothing yet. He lowers his glass. He takes a deep breath (only now taking a moment to pause for the morning). He looks up at the clouds. It doesn't seem good. He grabs a bottle of water and takes a sip. Thereafter he picks up a banana and starts peeling it. While peeling it, he sees a flash on the ocean's horizon. HE QUICKLY PULLS UP HIS VIEWING GLASS with the banana still in his one hand. He looks left and right to find the spot. He sees the flash, moves to view the area, but notices it is just the morning sun hitting the water in the distance. He lowers the glass and continues eating his banana.

FADE OUT:

EXT. CLIFF - NOON
The younger brother lifts a bottle of water. Not much water is left. He takes the last sip. We see a shot of many banana peels, an open coconut with a sharp rock next to it. We also see some rocks stacked on top of each other and some drawings in the sand (he clearly did this out of boredom). Not much water is coming out the bottle, he pulls back the bottle, sees it is empty, then tries to drip the last few drops into his mouth from the bottle. He closes the bottle and places it with the other empty bottles. He lifts his viewing glass, looks around, but doesn't see anything. He looks towards his brother's location and stares for a bit. Then looks up with his viewing glass again. He doesn't see anything for a second time. Then he quickly starts packing his stuff and climbs down.

INT. CAVE - LATER

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'm baaaack.

The younger brother walks in with a happy tone. He puts down all his stuff, then walks to his brother. His brother is shivering a bit. The younger brother gets a little fright, but quickly grabs one of the bottles above his brother, wets the coconut hairs again, and places it on his brother's forehead. He stares at his brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
They are almost here. Just a little longer. I spoke to the captain over the radio. He says that they are running a bit late.

He pulls the blankets over his brother and rubs him for a little bit. He stops shivering.

YOUNGER BROTHER
They are going to be here soon. Just a little longer.

They just sit for a while.

OLDER BROTHER
I..lo...u

The older brother mumbles something. THE YOUNGER BROTHER IS SURPRISED TO HEAR SOMETHING.

YOUNGER BROTHER
What did you say?

The older brother tries to lick his lips. The younger brother bows down to get his ear next to his brother's mouth.

OLDER BROTHER
(very softly)
I love you.

The younger brother sits back up looking at his older brother, kind of surprised at the comment. The younger brother bows back down to his brother's ear.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(whispers)
I love you too.

The younger brother hugs the older one.

We see the same shot of the walkie talkie next to the older brother as the younger brother gets up. In the background the younger brother starts collecting what he needs to go out again.

YOUNGER BROTHER
The water and food is still next to you if you need it. I'm heading out again. The next time I come back I'm fetching you! I promise!...Bye! See you later!

The younger brother leaves the cave, we are left with the close up of the older brother and the walkie talkie. We watch him for a long time.

OLDER BROTHER
(tear rolls down his cheek)
Bye.

EXT. CLIFF - NOON
THE CLOUDS ARE THICK AND GREY, THE WIND IS BLOWING A LOT NOW. The younger brother climbs up the last view steps and reaches his ledge. He sees that the wind has blown away all his leaves. He sits down, this time putting everything against his body so the wind won't get it. He pulls out his looking glass and looks at the horizon, sees nothing. He picks up his walkie talkie.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Sergeant, nothing to report yet. Over and away.

The camera pans away from the bother. In the very distance, we see a faint lightning flash (but no sound). The brother doesn't see this, only the camera does.

FADE OUT:

EXT. CLIFF - AFTERNOON
The sun is starting to set, the wind is very bad now, the clouds are very thick and moving. A DROP FALLS ON THE YOUNGER BROTHER'S HAND as he is playing in the sand with a stick. He looks up at the sky, he holds out his hand, but no more drops land. While his hand is out and he is looking up, something on the ocean catches his eye, a glitter. He pauses, looks at the spot where his eye caught something. He squints with his eyes. THE GLITTER AGAIN. He quickly picks up his viewing glass and looks through it. A SHIP! HE STANDS UP. HE LOOKS WITHOUT HIS VIEWING GLASS. A SHIP FOR SURE! He drops his viewing glass, he is confused, scared, excited, breathing heavily. He looks down at the water and items he has brought along. He looks up at the ship again. A SHIP FOR SURE! He rushes down, leaving everything behind.

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
The younger brother reaches the cave's entrance, totally out of breath, tripping in the sand as he runs faster than his legs can carry him. The sun is starting to set.

YOUNGER BROTHER
THEY'RE HERE! THE SHIP IS HERE!

He just shouts this into the cave entrance at his brother, then turns back outside and runs for the fire location.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I'M GOING TO START THE FIRE! I'LL COME AND GET YOU NOW!

He turns back to the fire location and runs.

We see a close up shot of the older brother lying next to the radio. He is shivering lightly and moaning softly.

We cut back to the younger brother on the beach, running to the fire location. Everything is laid out perfectly to start the fire like a chef who's knives are perfectly laid out in parallel. There are multiples of everything in case he needs more of something. Multiple spindles, multiple stacks of thin twigs, multiple rocks with coconut hairs under them. He sits down in a dedicated spot. He lifts a rock and takes the coconut hairs under it. As he readies the spindle to begin, a drop hits his hand. HE PAUSES, FRIGHTENED. He looks up slowly. A we see a flash and hear thunder. THE WEATHER IS BAD.

We see a shot of the raft. The yellow plastic sail flapping wildly in the wind.

He looks down, doesn't care, and starts spinning the spindle just as his brother taught him. First slow and precise, then progressively getting faster. He is very focused on the spinning now. Another drop hits his hand, for a moment he gets pulled out of the focus he is in. He looks up while still spinning. We hear a lightning strike again. Another drop in his eye. The wind is blowing a lot. He looks back at his task, a few more drops are falling around him. Smoke starts coming out of the coconut hairs. He spins faster and faster. The rain starts pouring more and more. We see the worry in his face now. He gets up and bends over the fire to shield it from the rain. He keeps on spinning. HIS SPINDLE BREAKS. Without a second of thought, he reaches to the back of him, grabs another spindle, brings it under him and continues. The smoke dies down a little bit as the new spindle warms up. He is spinning at full speed though.

We cut back to the brother inside, the close up of him and the radio. He is looking very bad. He is shivering and moaning more than earlier. We hear thunder while we watch him for a bit.

Back at the younger brother on the beach. He looks very worried. The rain is now softly pouring around him. He looks up at the horizon for the ship. He looks around to find it, finally he sees it! He looks back down and focuses even more! He spins really quickly. The smoke is now very thick. The rain is pouring. He is shielding the rain like a big roof. He stops spinning, bows down, and starts blowing at the smoke. His face gets lost in the smoke as he blows. We see a glimmer, THEN FIRE! He has done it! He bends to the side and grabs the first pile of thin twigs. He holds them over the fire to start burning. They aren't burning very well, he grabs a second pile of thin twigs (meant for the other coconut hair and spindle). This time he shakes the water off of it a bit, he puts it on the fire. The fire starts going now. HE HAS SOME HOPE AGAIN. He takes the second pile of thick sticks and places it on the fire. He keeps it covered as much as he can. The fire has now grown a lot. The wind is blowing very hard which makes it hard for him to keep sheltering the fire. Eventually his face starts burning and he has to step away from the fire, wiping the burn off of his face. The fire is strong even in the light rain. He piles even more logs onto the fire. He runs back to the cave.

We stay with a close up of the fire. We see a shot of the raft again. The yellow plastic sail still flapping wildly in the wind.

The younger brother reaches the cave.

YOUNGER BROTHER
The fire is going. They'll see us soon! Come, we need to get out. WE'RE GOING HOME!!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
The heart monitoring machine beeps softly in the background.

We see the face of the LITTLE GIRL introduced at the start of the film. She is holding her teddy bear tightly against her. Her eyes are wide open.
LITTLE GIRL
Did you go home!?

(the old man whispers in this scene while telling the story)

OLD MAN
Well...The rain kept pouring but it wasn't enough to kill my BIG FIRE.

The old man tickles the little girl as he says "BIG FIRE".

OLD MAN
And then. You know what we heard next?

The little girl just looks at the old man. There is an awkward wait for an answer. No response.

OLD MAN
(laughs at the no response)
WE HEARD THE SHIPS HORN!

LITTLE GIRL
(loudly)
TOOOOO!!! TOOO...

OLD MAN
(a loud whisper)
Sshhhhhh, Shhhhhh!!!

The old man stopped the girls tooooo tooo by placing his finger over her mouth.

OLD MAN
We need to be quiet, remember, the people are sleeping.

LITTLE GIRL
(whispers now)
Ah, sorry!

OLD MAN
It's alright.

LITTLE GIRL
So did your mamma pick you up?

The old man frowns at the little girl and tilts his head. He seems confused.

OLD MAN
No maaaaan. That is why I told you the story (patting her on the head) You asked where my mamma was. I lost my mamma and dadda when the sailboat sank.

He just looks at the little girl. Her face is doing something weird. Everything is starting to rattle.
LITTLE GIRL
So you lost them? You lost your mamma and dadda?

OLD MAN
Yes?

The little girl breaks out in tears.

OLD MAN
(quickly pulls the girl closer next to him)
It's alright! Don't worry! It was a very, very long time ago so I'm not sad anymore.

The old man pulls the girl next to him. He comforts her by pulling the cover over her and giving her a big hug. They are both sitting in the 45 degree hospital bed, something between sitting upright and lying down.

The girl looks at the old man. The old man has laid back and is looking up at the ceiling.

LITTLE GIRL
(in snot and tears)
But...

Old man's eyes look sideways, but his head doesn't turn to her.

LITTLE GIRL
But where is your brother then?

The old man smiles at the smart question.

OLD MAN
He's....he's not here right now.

LITTLE GIRL
Why? Why is he not here with you?

OLD MAN
Uhmmm...he is waiting for me.

LITTLE GIRL
Waiting for you where?

OLD MAN
Waiting...at home. I'm going home tomorrow.

LITTLE GIRL
Oh...

They lie for a while. The little girl has calmed down.

LITTLE GIRL
It is good that you are getting out tomorrow hey! My mommy is also getting out tomorrow. Then we can both go home.

The old man's eyes are red and watery.

OLD MAN
Yeah...it is good.

The old man hugs the little girl.
The screen fades to black and holds the black screen JUST LONG ENOUGH to make the viewers think the film might be over...we start hearing rain...and then lightning.

EXT. BEACH
The younger brother who has just entered the cave, runs to his older brother, who is still lying in the same position. He is shivering and moaning immensely. The younger brother, full of energy, was just about to pull the older brother over onto his back, when he paused. He stops his rushing. He pulls his older brother over slowly. The older brother is looking VERY BAD. The younger brother puts his hand on his older brother's stomach to check for breathing. He is still alive.

YOUNGER BROTHER
They are almost here. I promise! Just hold out a little more. You hear that! THEY ARE ALMOST HERE!

We cut back to a close up of the fire on the beach. The rain, wind and thunder is getting worse. The fire is dying out.

Back in the cave, the younger brother grabs a big palm leaf, he slowly and carefully pulls his brother onto it. He also grabs their blankets, and places it over the older brother for protection from the rain. The older brother is like a dead body, not helping at the slightest. The younger brother battles, but gets his brother onto the palm leaf. He starts pulling his brother out to the cave's entrance. It is not an easy task, his brother is very strong.

YOUNGER BROTHER
battling while pulling his brother Can you still hear me??? I'm taking you out the cave now. You're going to get wet but we need to wait at the...NO NOOOO NOOOOOO!!!
HE DROPS HIS OLDER BROTHER. The older brother rolls off the leaf and halfway onto his face, he still has space to breathe, but his lips are on the sand. The older brother is still shivering and moaning a lot. THE YOUNGER BROTHER RUNS OUT INTO THE RAIN.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(starting to cry from frustration)
No no no no no, please, no, PLEASE!

The younger brother arrives at the dead fire. He quickly pushes off the big sticks from the fire to get to the embers. He covers his body like a roof again. He bows down and starts blowing at the burnt coconut hairs. The ember glows, but no flames are coming out. He keeps blowing and blowing, but it doesn't work. He picks up a spindle, it is VERY WET, he wipes it off with his wet shirt as good as he can. He places it back on to the coconut hairs and starts spinning as fast as he can. He is crying. The water is running down his arms, down the spindle, and on to the coconut hair. He keeps trying out of frustration but it isn't working anymore. He stops and reaches to the side of him to another batch of coconut hairs under a rock. He picks it up. It is super wet, he squeezes the water out of it. He cries even more.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(begging)
No, no, no. Pleasssee.

He looks up at the ship. The flapping sail on the raft catches his attention. His face is full of tears and rain. The ship is still there in view. He looks back down. He picks up another pile of coconut hairs, squeezes as well. Again water runs out.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying even more)
NO. NOOO. PLEASSSSE! PLEASSSSSSSSE!!!!

He gets up and picks up every piece of wood around him. None of the coconut hairs he finds are dry enough to try something with. He just cries as he picks everything up, everything is wet. He starts throwing and kicking everything, having a tantrum. He stands up and starts waving in the rain.

YOUNGER BROTHER
HEEEEEEEELP!!! OVER HEREEEEE!!! HEEEEEEELP!!!!

The wind is blowing him, the rain is POURING down on him. He is frustrated and crying. He doesn't know what to do anymore. He knows they can't possibly hear him.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(softly)
Over here...please.

He has given up. There is no use.

The flapping of the sail on the raft draws his attention again, the wind is blowing it a lot. He looks to his brother at the cave's entrance as if his brother is going to give him an idea.

WE CUT TO THE CLOSE UP OF THE HALF DEAD BROTHER LYING IN THE SAND.

Back to the younger brother, he looks out at the ship in the distance. He is out of ideas. He is crying, frustrated. He looks at the raft again. He stops crying for a few seconds as he watches the sail getting flapped around in the wind. He looks at the ship in the distance. Back at the raft. HE HAS GOT IT!

He QUICKLY runs towards his brother. He has stopped crying now. He gets to his brother. Turns him back on to the leaf, this time not paying much attention to his older brother's state.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(shouting through the storm)
I've got a plan! Trust me!

He starts dragging his older brother into the rain. A close up of the older brother shows the rain hitting his face without him being able to do anything about it. They reach the raft. The younger brother tries his best to get the limp body of his older brother onto the raft. He finally gets him on, takes the blankets and tucks his brother under them.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Don't worry! I'm right here! I promise!

He covers his older brother's face as well, the older brother is lying with his face to the side, so he has space to breathe. At least the wind is not hitting his face anymore. The younger brother starts pushing the raft into the water. The sea is looking extremely rough. He battles a lot to push the raft as it is very heavy for him. SUDDENLY, the ocean pulls the raft away under his feet. He drops into the water but quickly gets back up to get a hold of the raft. He climbs on, slipping and knocking his knee in the process. As he gets on top he loses his balance and falls back down. He crawls towards the flag's main sail line and pulls it down with all his strength. It is not an easy thing to do with the wind blowing so strongly. He ties it to the raft, the raft starts getting pulled now. He quickly moves over to the rudder, places it in its position. He is ready to sail the raft.

He sails it as good as he can but getting through the surf area is a daunting task. With the big swells they get picked up and smashed back down onto the water surface. THE ANCHOR (ROCK) ROLLS BACK AND FORTH ON THE RAFT.

A SHOT OF UNDER THE BLANKET SHOWS THE HALF DEAD OLDER BROTHER GETTING SLAMMED AGAIN THE RAFT.

The younger brother pulls his older brother closer so that he doesn't fall off. Another wave hits and the same happens.

He sees a BIG wave approach them. He lets go of the rudder and grabs a hold of his brother with both arms. THE WAVE HITS THEM. It tilts the raft a lot, to the point where the younger brother needs to reposition himself to keep holding on. THE ANCHOR ROLLS PAST THEM AND DROPS INTO THE WATER.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No! NOOOO!!!

The anchor pulls the raft sideways as it spins 180 degrees around. The younger brother places his older brother safely down.

WE SEE ANOTHER CLOSE UP SHOT OF THE OLDER BROTHER, BARELY ALIVE, NOW MUMBLED UNDER THE BLANKETS.

The younger brother crawls to the rope where the anchor is tied on to. He battles to get the knot loose. It won't budge.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(starting to cry from frustration)
Come on!

He realises another idea. He pulls up the rope connecting the anchor to the raft. It is not easy to pull up the rope as it is very tight. He just, just gets the rope to slip over one of the big logs of the raft. He starts pulling the rope back and forth along the log. IT STARTS TO TEAR THE ROPE. He rubs more and more. Eventually it snaps. THE RELEASE OF TENSION SHOOTS THE BROTHERS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RAFT. The younger brother catches the older brother while they roll away. He pulls them both back to the rubber. He grabs a hold of the rudder with his one hand, with his other hand he holds onto his older brother.

We see another shot of the older brother. HE IS NOW SHIVERING AND MOANING A LOT!

The younger brother covers his eyes from the rain to try and scout where the ship is. He sees where the ship is. They need to turn right around. He gets a fright. He quickly pulls the rudder to start turning the raft around. The rudder is very hard to pull.

SUDDENLY a gust of wind hits the sail. It rotates the raft away again. Again the younger brother does his best to try and pull the rudder in the right direction. HE HEARS A CRACK. He pauses, stops adding pressure and looks down at the rudder. He is unsure of what just happened. He slowly pulls the rudder to one side. It has no tension. FEAR GROWS ON HIS FACE. He pulls the rudder to the other direction. No tension.

YOUNGER BROTHER
No...

He pulls the rudder up slowly. IT IS BROKEN. The fin of the rudder has snapped off and is hanging loosely from the handle.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(starting to cry)
No, no, no...

He quickly puts it back in and turns the rudder to the direction he wants to go. The raft is not responding.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying)
No. Pleaseee. Come on!

He pulls the rudder back out. It is broken for sure. He holds it in his hands. The wind is hitting him, the waves are chaotic, the rain is hitting him. He holds the rudder and looks at his brother under the blankets as he cries.

We see another shot of the older brother, shivering and moaning EVEN MORE.

Although the younger brother is now out of motivation, he tries something. Through his crying, he loosens one of the more flat logs from the raft. He pushes it down where the previous rudder was, it has some tension, he turns the log with his hands, it has a minor effect on the raft's direction. He isn't putting in much effort though, since he knows it probably won't mean anything. A BIG SWELL hits them and pulls the board down, out of his hands. He is now crying even more. He pulls his brother closer, holding onto him like a teddy for comfort. He just sits with his brother in the storm as the raft is pushed up and down.

While crying, he looks up at the sail, it is flapping loosely because the raft has turned a lot since he tied down the sail. He looks at the ship in the distance. He pauses his crying for a moment. He looks at the flapping flag and again at the ship. He puts his brother down again.

The younger brother gets up, loosens the main sail from its anchor point, rotates the sail so that it catches the wind in the direction of the ship.He pulls really hard to get the sail catching as much wind as possible. While pulling against the force of the wind, HE SLIPS. He lands face down on the raft, he has let go of the sail's rope and it is now flapping on the pole. He gets up.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(angry & crying)
Aaaaaaagggrrrhhhh!!! COME ON!

He tries to grab a hold of the rope again which is now flapping in the wind. He catches it. He pulls the sail back again to get it into the wind as much as possible. The direction the wind is blowing is not the same as the ship's direction, but at least it is into the same general direction. As he pulls to get the sail in the right direction THE WIND IS NOW PULLING THE RAFT IMMENSELY. We hear as the sail is fighting the pull of the wind.

THE SAIL TEARS.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(screaming & crying)
No. No! NO!

He lets the tension go a bit to stop the tearing. A GUSH OF WIND MAKES THE SAIL BUBBLE UP LIKE A KITE. THE TEAR SPREADS OVER THE RAFT.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(screaming & crying)
NOOOOOOO!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

He runs to the ripped part of the sail and picks it up as if holding it up might seal it. It is hopeless. He tries whatever he can but nothing has an effect any more. It is over.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Noooooo!!! Noooo...No....

He sits back down with his brother. The raft is now a wreck. The broken rudder is lying on the surface. The tensionless sail is flapping in the wind. The once main sail is now an empty wooden "4-frame" in the air. The younger brother is sitting with his older brother in his lap. The older brother is still covered in the blankets (especially his face). They are just a spec on the ocean.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(snickering, crying with snot and tears in on his lips)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't...know...what...to do.

We see another shot of the older brother...HE IS HAVING A SEIZURE.

The younger brother feels his brother shaking uncontrollably under the blankets but just holds him and cries on his head as the raft is drifting in the storm. He can't do anything for his brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
I love you! I LOVE YOU.

The young brother kisses the older brother on the head.

YOUNGER BROTHER
You are the best brother I have ever had. You are the best friend I have ever had. Please don't leave me here. Please don't leave me alone. I'm scared. I need you. (snickering) Please...

Cries on his brother's head.

We see another shot of the older brother, HE IS STILL HAVING A SEIZURE. FOAM COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

The younger brother slowly looks up at the ship, it is actually not too far out anymore. HE NOTICES THE DIDGERIDOO TIED ONTO THE SIDE OF THE RAFT. He slows his crying for a second. HE HAS A PLAN.

YOUNGER BROTHER
WAIT!

HE JUMPS UP AND RIPS THE DIDGERIDOO OFF OF THE RAFT WHERE IT WAS ATTACHED. He starts blowing it. We just hear his breath, no sound. He pulls back. He wipes off his face and his lips. He blows again. Still no sound.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying)
No please. Come on. PLEASEEE!!!

He wipes his mouth even more and also wipes off the didgeridoo. He blows again. He blows. He blows...SOUND! For a second the blowing made the didgeridoo sound. He blows even faster. AGAIN! He blows even more. He pulls back for a breath and clears his mouth again. He blows! THE DIDGERIDOO SOUND IS COMING OUT CONSTANTLY NOW. A low, LOUD rumble. It sounds a lot like a ship's horn.

As he blows he looks up at the ship. He keeps blowing. MORE AND MORE. LOUDER AND LOUDER. A searching light lights up somewhere on what looks like a lookout tower.

The younger brother gets excited!! HE KEEPS BLOWING.

We see a shot of the older brother. The camera stays on him for a while as we hear the younger brother blow the didgeridoo. HE IS NO LONGER SHIVERING. His body is completely still...eyes open...mouth open.

The ship's light searches the ocean. It is searching very sporadically, not having an idea where the sound is coming from. The younger brother is gaining strength he didn't know he had. HE BLOWS, FAST AND LOUD. The light keeps on searching the ocean. THE LIGHT PASSES OVER THEM.

The younger brother's eyes pop wide open! THEY WERE SPOTTED. He blows even more, but from the excitement the blowing has become very inconsistent. The younger brother is now waving his one hand in the air to grab even more attention. He keeps blowing. THE LIGHT PASSES BACK PAST THEM AGAIN. THE BROTHER DROPS THE DIDGERIDOO AND WAVES WITH BOTH HANDS. THE LIGHT TURNS BACK AND CENTRES ON THEM.

The light flashes a few times, indicating that they see the boys on the raft.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(screaming and crying from excitement!!!)
YESSSSS! YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS. HERE!!! WERE HERE!!!!!

The younger brother is very excited now!

YOUNGER BROTHER
(towards his brother)
THEY SEE US! THEY SEE US!!!

The younger brother falls on his knees and picks up his older brother who is still under the blanket.

YOUNGER BROTHER
THEY FOUND US, WERE SAV...

He opens the blanket over his brother's face. He sees his brother's eyes are open. He shakes his brother.

YOUNGER BROTHER
Can you hear me!?

He shakes his brother. No response, the limp head just bobbles around. The younger brother steadies his older brother's face.

YOUNGER BROTHER
They are here! Can you hear me?!

He shakes his brother even more.

YOUNGER BROTHER
(now the crying has turned into sadness again)
Nooo. They are here. Nooooo. Please no. THEY ARE HERE. WE ARE SAVED. PLEASE. THEY ARE RIGHT HERE.

The younger brother looks up at the ship. The light is still shining right on them.

YOUNGER BROTHER
NO. NO. NO. NOOO. NOOOO. PLEAAAAASE. NOOOOOO. WE'RE SAVED. PLEASSSSSSE!!!

He looks at his dead brother's face.

YOUNGER BROTHER
screaming like a demon now NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

He holds his brother's head tightly in his arm, in his lap.

YOUNGER BROTHER
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

....

YOUNGER BROTHER
(crying on his brother's head, now speaking softly)
Nooo. Pleassse. I did it. I saved us. We're going on the ship. Pleassse don't leave me. Pleaaaase. Pleaaaaaaaase. Come back. Please come back.

We see a wide shot of the ocean. The raft is in full light. The younger brother is holding the older brother, crying on his head.

FADE OUT:

We cut to black. The sound slowly transitions back to the hospital beeping sounds. We give the audience a good amount of time to calm down.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
We see the old man staring at the ceiling. Tears are now running down his face. He wipes off his face. He looks at the ceiling.

OLD MAN
See you soon...

.Writing Information

Started on 3 November 2020 in Centurion, South Africa, Francois' home.

Finished first draft on 22 November 2020.

.Story Changes

The story started out with only the little boy getting stranded. The concept was that he wanted a toy, but his family could never afford one. While on the island, he started making toys to keep him company (like Wilson in Cast Away). At the end of the film (when he gets saved) he opens a toy shop. There are hints to the fact that he is the original Santa Claus. This idea was dropped in favor of the older brother concept.

There was an idea to make one of the brother's cripple. This was dropped just because it seemed it might be an overkill more than anything else.
